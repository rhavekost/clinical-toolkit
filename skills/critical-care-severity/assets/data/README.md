# Critical Care Data Files

This directory stores local data needed for complex severity models that are not bundled with the toolkit.

## APACHE IV Coefficients
Place APACHE IV coefficient tables and model definitions in:

`skills/critical-care-severity/assets/data/apache-iv/`

Use the schema documented in:
`skills/critical-care-severity/assets/apache-iv-coefficients-schema.md`

## Notes
- Store coefficients as read-only source data.
- Keep the original citation and version metadata with the file.
