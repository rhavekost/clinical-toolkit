# Functional Impairment Interview (Non‑Validated)

## Description

This is an **original, non‑validated** interview guide for functional impact. It does **not** replace validated disability instruments.

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.

1. Confirm this is a non-validated interview guide and check readiness.
2. Ask one domain at a time from the interview guide and wait for a response.
3. Summarize functional impacts and confirm accuracy before moving on.
4. At the end, synthesize impairment patterns and suggested next steps.
5. If safety concerns arise, pause and follow appropriate safety protocols.
