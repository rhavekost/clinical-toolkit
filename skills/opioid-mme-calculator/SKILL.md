# Opioid MME Calculator

## Description

This skill provides a structured way to calculate total daily MME using CDC conversion factors and safety cautions. It is a support tool and does not replace clinical judgment or patient-specific considerations.

## Quick Reference

| Use | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| MME calculation | Standardize opioid dose comparisons and monitor risk |

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to calculate MME step-by-step.

1. Confirm readiness and the target time period (current daily regimen).
2. Collect one medication at a time: name, route, dose, and frequency.
3. Clarify PRN vs scheduled dosing and any long-acting vs short-acting formulations.
4. Calculate per-opioid MME and then total daily MME.
5. Summarize results and reference safety cautions.
