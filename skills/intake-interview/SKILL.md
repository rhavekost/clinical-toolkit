# Intake Interview

## Description

This skill provides structured interview guides and frameworks for comprehensive clinical intake assessment. These frameworks help ensure thorough evaluation while maintaining a conversational, patient-centered approach.

**Clinical Context:** Structured interviews help clinicians gather essential information systematically while building therapeutic rapport. These are support frameworks that guide, not replace, clinical judgment and individualized assessment.

## Available Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Population | Key Domains |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **HEADSS Assessment** | Psychosocial screening | Adolescents | Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Safety |
| **Biopsychosocial Template** | Comprehensive intake | All ages | Biological, psychological, social factors |
| **Safety Assessment Protocol** | Risk evaluation | All ages | Suicide, homicide, violence, safety planning |

## Response Style

- Start with the Quick Reference table below.
- Ask if the user wants the detailed prompt banks and decision pathways.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Explain confidentiality and limits (mandatory reporting) |
| 2 | Screen safety early (SI/HI/abuse) |
| 3 | Run HEADSS or Biopsychosocial |
| 4 | Summarize 4Ps formulation and level of care |

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.

1. Confirm readiness and explain confidentiality/limits before starting.
2. Screen safety early (SI/HI/abuse) and pause if urgent concerns arise.
3. Ask one domain at a time from the selected framework and wait for responses.
4. Summarize key findings and confirm accuracy before moving on.
5. At the end, synthesize 4Ps and suggested next steps.

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Conduct a comprehensive intake interview
- Screen adolescents for psychosocial concerns
- Structure a biopsychosocial assessment
- Perform a systematic safety evaluation
- Ensure thorough documentation of intake

**Example requests:**
- "Help me conduct an intake interview"
- "Guide me through a HEADSS assessment"
- "I need a biopsychosocial interview template"
- "How do I structure a safety assessment?"

## Framework Details

### HEADSS Assessment (Adolescent Psychosocial Screening)

- Do you feel safe where you live?

**Education/Employment**
- How is school or work going? Attendance and performance?
- Any bullying, learning challenges, or major stressors?
- Goals or plans for the next year?

**Activities**

### Biopsychosocial Template

**Purpose:** Comprehensive intake structure addressing biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to current presentation.

**Biological Factors:**
- Medical history, current medications
- Sleep, appetite, energy
- Substance use
- Family medical/psychiatric history

**Psychological Factors:**
- Mental status examination

- Previous mental health treatment
- Trauma history
- Coping strategies

**Social Factors:**
- Relationships and support system
- Living situation and safety
- Employment/education/finances
- Cultural and spiritual factors
- Legal involvement

**Interview Guide (Prompt Bank):**

**Presenting Problem**
- Chief complaint in the patient's words
- Onset, duration, triggers, and course
- Current stressors and functional impact

**Biological Factors**
- Medical history, current medications, allergies
- Sleep, appetite, energy, pain
- Substance use and withdrawal symptoms
- Family medical and psychiatric history

**Psychological Factors**
- Mood, anxiety, trauma exposure, psychosis symptoms
- Prior mental health treatment and response
- Coping strategies and strengths
- Suicidality or self-harm history

**Social Factors**
- Housing stability and safety
- Relationships and support system
- Education/employment and finances
- Cultural, spiritual, and identity factors
- Legal issues or custody concerns

**Strengths and Resources**
- Protective factors, resiliency, motivation
- Community supports and prior successes

**Documentation Template (Biopsychosocial Intake Summary):**
- Identifying info
- Presenting problem and history of present illness
- Biological factors
- Psychological factors
- Social factors
- Risk assessment (suicide, violence, safety)
- Strengths and protective factors
- Diagnostic impression (provisional)
- Level of care recommendation
- Initial treatment plan and next steps

### Safety Assessment Protocol

**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of suicide, homicide, and safety risks with clear decision pathways.

**Key Components:**
1. **Suicide Risk Assessment**
   - Current ideation, intent, plan, means
   - Prior attempts and self-harm
   - Protective factors
   - Risk stratification

2. **Violence Risk Assessment**
   - Homicidal ideation
   - History of violence
   - Access to weapons
   - Target identification

3. **Safety Planning**
   - Warning signs
   - Coping strategies
   - Support contacts
   - Means restriction
   - Emergency resources

4. **Disposition Decision**
   - Level of care determination
   - Follow-up planning
   - Documentation requirements

**Decision Pathway (Text-Based):**
1. **Screen for safety early** (SI, HI, abuse, domestic violence, psychosis).
2. **Imminent risk** (active intent, plan, means, or recent attempt):
   - Emergency evaluation, do not leave patient alone, initiate emergency protocol.
3. **Moderate risk** (active ideation without intent/plan, recent escalation):
   - Full risk assessment, same-day clinical evaluation, increase contact frequency.
4. **Low risk** (passive ideation only, no plan/intent):
   - Safety plan, coping supports, outpatient follow-up.
5. **No current risk**:
   - Routine monitoring and preventive safety education.

**Violence Risk Quick Check:**
- Any thoughts of harming others?
- Any specific target, plan, or access to weapons?
- History of violence or recent escalation?

## Clinical Interpretation

**Clinical Formulation (4Ps Model):**
- **Predisposing:** long-term vulnerabilities (trauma history, family history, temperament)
- **Precipitating:** recent triggers (loss, conflict, medical illness)
- **Perpetuating:** maintaining factors (avoidance, substance use, unstable housing)
- **Protective:** strengths and supports (relationships, values, coping skills)

**Synthesis Checklist:**
- Working diagnosis and severity
- Functional impairment and role impact
- Risk level and safety needs
- Level of care recommendation
- Initial treatment focus and goals

**Key Questions:**
- What is the presenting problem and precipitants?
- What biological, psychological, and social factors contribute?
- What are the patient's strengths and resources?
- What level of care is appropriate?
- What are the treatment priorities?

## Safety Protocols

**During intake assessment:**
- Assess safety concerns early in interview
- Be prepared to interrupt interview flow for safety issues
- Have emergency protocols readily available
- Know your crisis resources and referral pathways
- Document all safety concerns and interventions

**Mandatory Reporting:**
- Be aware of mandatory reporting requirements (child abuse, elder abuse, danger to others)
- Explain confidentiality limits at start of interview
- Consult when uncertain about reporting obligations

**Safety Protocols and Escalation:**
- Assess safety before and after sensitive topics.
- If imminent risk, follow emergency protocol and document all actions.
- Use standardized tools (ASQ, C-SSRS) when indicated.
- Develop a safety plan for any positive screen or elevated risk.
- Discuss means safety (firearms, medications) and document counseling.
- Coordinate with supervisors and collateral supports when appropriate.
- Follow mandatory reporting laws (child/elder abuse, danger to others).

## Limitations & Considerations

**These are support frameworks, not rigid protocols:**
- Adapt to patient's presentation and needs
- Maintain conversational, empathic approach
- Cultural humility in all assessments
- Trauma-informed approach
- Language and health literacy considerations
- Allow patient to guide pacing and depth
- Clinical judgment supersedes checklist completion

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Family structure and roles vary across cultures
- Expression of distress differs
- Help-seeking behaviors culturally influenced
- Spirituality and traditional healing
- Immigration and acculturation stress
- Interpreter services when needed

**Trauma-Informed Approach:**
- Establish safety and choice
- Transparency about process
- Allow patient control over disclosure
- Recognize potential for re-traumatization
- Avoid forcing trauma narrative in initial intake

**Additional Considerations:**
- Avoid checklist-only interviews; maintain therapeutic alliance.
- Use trauma-informed, culturally responsive language.
- Use interpreters when needed; document language access steps.
- Be mindful of developmental stage and health literacy.
- Reassess risk dynamically; it can change within the session.
