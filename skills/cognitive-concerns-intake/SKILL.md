# Cognitive Concerns Intake (Non‑Validated)

## Description

This is an **original, non‑validated** intake guide for cognitive complaints. It does **not** replace validated cognitive instruments.

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.

1. Confirm this is a non-validated intake guide and check readiness.
2. Ask one prompt at a time from the intake guide and wait for a response.
3. Summarize key points and confirm accuracy before moving on.
4. At the end, synthesize cognitive concerns, functional impact, and suggested next steps.
5. If safety concerns arise, pause and follow appropriate safety protocols.
