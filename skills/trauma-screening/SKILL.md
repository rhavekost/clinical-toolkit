# Trauma Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated PTSD and trauma screening instruments. The PC-PTSD-5 serves as a brief initial screener, while the PCL-5 provides comprehensive assessment of PTSD symptom severity aligned with DSM-5 criteria.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify probable PTSD, quantify symptom severity, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive trauma-informed clinical evaluation.

**⚠️ TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACH REQUIRED:** All trauma screening must follow trauma-informed principles. See [references/trauma-informed-approach.md](references/trauma-informed-approach.md) for essential guidance.

## Quick Reference: Assessment Selection

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Cutoff | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **PC-PTSD-5** | 5 | 1-2 min | Brief screen | ≥3 | Primary care, triage, initial screening |
| **PCL-5** | 20 | 5-10 min | Comprehensive assessment | ≥33 | After positive PC-PTSD-5, treatment monitoring |

**Decision guide:** Start with PC-PTSD-5 for quick screening. If score ≥3, administer full PCL-5. See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md) for detailed guidance.

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for PTSD symptoms
- Assess PTSD severity
- Track trauma treatment response
- Quantify symptom changes
- Monitor recovery progress

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for PTSD"
- "I need to administer a PCL-5"
- "Can you score this trauma screening?"
- "Interpret these PTSD assessment results"

## Quick Reference: Severity Levels

### PC-PTSD-5 Interpretation
- **0-2:** Negative screen - PTSD unlikely, routine monitoring
- **≥3:** Positive screen - Administer full PCL-5 for comprehensive assessment

### PCL-5 Severity Levels
- **0-30:** Subclinical/mild - Watchful waiting, psychoeducation
- **31-44:** Moderate PTSD - Evidence-based trauma therapy recommended
- **45-59:** Severe PTSD - Active treatment strongly recommended, specialty referral
- **≥60:** Extreme PTSD - Immediate intervention, consider higher level of care

**Treatment response:** 10-20 point decrease = clinically significant improvement

For detailed severity interpretations and treatment recommendations, see [references/severity-levels.md](references/severity-levels.md)

## Assessment Administration

### PC-PTSD-5 (Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5)

**Complete assessment details:** [assets/pc-ptsd-5.md](assets/pc-ptsd-5.md)

**Quick Facts:**
- 5 binary (Yes/No) questions covering DSM-5 PTSD symptom clusters
- Score 1 point for each "Yes" response
- Cutoff ≥3: Optimal balance of sensitivity (93%) and specificity (85%)
- Positive screen indicates need for full PTSD assessment (PCL-5)
- Requires trauma exposure; not administered if no trauma history

**Items (1 point each for "Yes"):**
1. Nightmares/intrusive thoughts about trauma
2. Avoidance of trauma reminders
3. Hypervigilance/easily startled
4. Detachment/numbing
5. Guilt/self-blame

**Next Steps:**
- Score 0-2: Monitor, reassess if symptoms emerge
- Score ≥3: **Administer full PCL-5** for comprehensive assessment

### PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5)

**Complete assessment details:** [assets/pcl-5.md](assets/pcl-5.md)

**Quick Facts:**
- 20 items mapping to DSM-5 PTSD criteria (0-4 Likert scale)
- Total score range: 0-80
- Cutoff ≥33: Probable PTSD diagnosis (requires clinical interview to confirm)
- Tracks symptom severity and treatment response
- Can assess DSM-5 diagnostic criteria via cluster analysis

**Symptom Clusters:**
- **Cluster B (Items 1-5):** Intrusion symptoms (range 0-20)
- **Cluster C (Items 6-7):** Avoidance (range 0-8)
- **Cluster D (Items 8-14):** Negative cognitions/mood (range 0-28)
- **Cluster E (Items 15-20):** Arousal/reactivity (range 0-24)

**DSM-5 Provisional Diagnosis Criteria:**
- ≥1 Cluster B item rated ≥2 (Moderately or higher)
- ≥1 Cluster C item rated ≥2
- ≥2 Cluster D items rated ≥2
- ≥2 Cluster E items rated ≥2

**Clinical Cutoffs:**
- Total score ≥33: Probable PTSD (clinical interview required for formal diagnosis)
- 10-20 point change: Clinically significant improvement
- 5-10 point change: Reliable improvement

## Clinical Decision-Making

For structured clinical decision trees covering screening, treatment selection, safety assessment, and treatment monitoring, see [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

**Quick Treatment Selection:**
- **PCL-5 0-30:** Watchful waiting, psychoeducation, coping strategies
- **PCL-5 31-44:** Evidence-based trauma therapy (PE, CPT, EMDR) or medication
- **PCL-5 45-59:** Combination therapy + medication, specialty referral
- **PCL-5 ≥60:** Immediate specialty referral, consider higher level of care

**Evidence-Based Trauma Therapies:**
- Prolonged Exposure (PE)
- Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)

**Medication Options:**
- First-line SSRIs: Sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine
- SNRI: Venlafaxine

## Safety Protocols

**⚠️ TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE REQUIRED**

All trauma screening must follow trauma-informed principles:
- Establish safety and trust before administering
- Explain purpose and voluntary nature
- Allow patient to decline or pause at any time
- Patient controls pacing
- Be prepared for emotional reactions and dissociation
- Have grounding techniques ready
- Focus on symptoms, not trauma narrative
- Validate and normalize trauma responses

**Comprehensive trauma-informed guidance:** [references/trauma-informed-approach.md](references/trauma-informed-approach.md)

**Safety Assessment Required:**
- Screen for suicidal ideation separately (use ../../suicide-screening/ tools)
- Assess current safety and coping
- Any safety concerns require immediate intervention per [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

**Crisis Resources:**
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- Veterans Crisis Line: 988 then Press 1
- Emergency Services: 911

**When to Escalate:**
- Active suicidal ideation → Crisis intervention immediately
- Severe functional impairment → Specialty mental health referral
- PCL-5 ≥60 → Immediate specialty referral
- Psychotic symptoms, severe self-harm → Consider hospitalization

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- PCL-5 provides *provisional* diagnosis; clinical interview required for formal diagnosis
- Requires interpretation within trauma history context
- Cultural factors affect trauma expression
- Dissociation may affect accurate reporting
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Trauma-Informed Considerations:**
- Use collaborative, empowering approach
- Respect patient autonomy in assessment process
- Consider timing and therapeutic relationship
- Be aware of potential re-traumatization
- Avoid forcing disclosure of trauma details during screening
- See [references/trauma-informed-approach.md](references/trauma-informed-approach.md)

**Special Populations:**
- **Military/veteran populations:** Consider combat-specific contexts
- **Complex trauma:** PCL-5 may not capture full developmental/relational impact
- **Childhood trauma:** Consider developmental impact and attachment issues
- **Recent trauma (<1 month):** May be acute stress reaction, not PTSD; reassess at 1 month

**Comorbidity Considerations:**
PTSD commonly co-occurs with:
- Depression (50% comorbidity) - Screen with ../../depression-screening/
- Substance use disorders (30-50%) - Screen with ../../substance-screening/
- Anxiety disorders - Screen with ../../anxiety-screening/

Address comorbid conditions in treatment planning.
