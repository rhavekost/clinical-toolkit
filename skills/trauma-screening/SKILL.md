# Trauma Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated PTSD and trauma screening instruments. The PC-PTSD-5 serves as a brief initial screener, while the PCL-5 provides comprehensive assessment of PTSD symptom severity aligned with DSM-5 criteria.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify probable PTSD, quantify symptom severity, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive trauma-informed clinical evaluation.

## Available Assessments

| Assessment | Items | Purpose | Cutoffs | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **PC-PTSD-5** | 5 | Brief PTSD screening | 3-4 (consider gender differences) | Primary Care PTSD Screen |
| **PCL-5** | 20 | PTSD severity assessment | 31-33 for probable PTSD | Maps to DSM-5 criteria |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for PTSD symptoms
- Assess PTSD severity
- Track trauma treatment response
- Quantify symptom changes
- Monitor recovery progress

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for PTSD"
- "I need to administer a PCL-5"
- "Can you score this trauma screening?"
- "Interpret these PTSD assessment results"

## Administration & Scoring

### PC-PTSD-5 (Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5)

**Key Facts:**
- 5 yes/no questions covering DSM-5 PTSD symptom clusters
- Cutoff of 3 balances sensitivity and specificity
- Gender differences: cutoff of 4 may be optimal for males, 3 for females
- Developed by VA National Center for PTSD
- Positive screen indicates need for full PTSD assessment

### PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5)

**Key Facts:**
- 20 items mapping to DSM-5 PTSD criteria
- 4 subscales: Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Negative cognitions/mood, Arousal/reactivity
- Cutoff of 31-33 indicates probable PTSD
- 10-12 point change = clinically significant improvement
- Score <28 may indicate return to healthy population range
- Can be used to monitor weekly symptom changes

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Detailed interpretation guidelines for score ranges, clinical significance, and next steps to be added]*

**PCL-5 Score Ranges:**
- 0-30: Below probable PTSD threshold
- 31-33: Probable PTSD (provisional cutoff)
- Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity

**Subscale Interpretation:**
- Cluster B (Items 1-5): Intrusion symptoms
- Cluster C (Items 6-7): Avoidance
- Cluster D (Items 8-14): Negative alterations in cognitions and mood
- Cluster E (Items 15-20): Alterations in arousal and reactivity

## Safety Protocols

**Trauma screening requires trauma-informed care principles:**
- Establish safety and trust before administering
- Explain purpose and voluntary nature
- Allow patient to decline or pause
- Be prepared for emotional reactions
- Have crisis support available
- Assess for suicidal ideation if severe symptoms present

**Crisis Resources:**
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- Veterans Crisis Line: 988 then Press 1
- Emergency Services: 911

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- Requires interpretation within trauma history context
- Does not establish trauma type or chronology
- Cultural factors affect trauma expression
- Dissociation may affect accurate reporting
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Trauma-Informed Considerations:**
- Use collaborative, empowering approach
- Respect patient autonomy in assessment process
- Consider timing and therapeutic relationship
- Be aware of potential re-traumatization
- Cultural differences in trauma expression and coping
- Avoid forcing disclosure of trauma details during screening

**Special Populations:**
- Military/veteran populations: Consider combat-specific contexts
- Complex trauma: PCL-5 may not capture full picture
- Childhood trauma: Consider developmental impact
- Recent trauma: Symptoms may still be in acute stress phase

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
