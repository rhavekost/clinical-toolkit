# Well-Being Screening (WHO-5)

## Description

This skill provides the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a brief measure of positive well-being that complements symptom-focused screening.

**Permission:** WHO-5 is free of charge and does not require permission for use.

## Quick Reference

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Score Range |
|------------|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **WHO-5** | 5 | <1 min | Well-being screening | 0-25 raw (x4 to 0-100) |

## Assessment Tool

- **WHO-5**: [assets/who-5.md](assets/who-5.md)

## Interactive Administration (Optional)

Use this mode when the clinician says "start" or "administer" the WHO-5.

1. Confirm readiness and explain the past 2 weeks time frame plus the 0-5 response scale.
2. Ask one item at a time (verbatim from the asset file) and wait for a response before continuing.
3. Accept numeric or verbal responses; if unclear or out of range, ask for clarification.
4. Record each response, sum the raw score, and multiply by 4 to calculate the 0-100 index.
5. Interpret results per the asset file guidance and suggest next steps if indicated.
6. Offer a brief documentation summary if requested.

## Documentation
