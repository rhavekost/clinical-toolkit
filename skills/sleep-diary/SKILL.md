# Sleep Diary (Consensus Sleep Diary)

## Description

This skill supports use of the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) for longitudinal sleep monitoring. The CSD is permitted for not‑for‑profit use when unaltered and properly cited. This skill provides instructions, interpretation guidance, and a summary workflow.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Time | Purpose | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| **Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)** | Daily, 1-2 weeks | Track sleep patterns and treatment response | Use official unaltered diary form |

## Official Diary Form

**The official CSD form is not reproduced here.**
Use the unaltered form and include the required citation.
See: [assets/consensus-sleep-diary.md](assets/consensus-sleep-diary.md)

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician wants step-by-step guidance for diary use.

1. Provide the official CSD form and explain the daily completion expectation.
2. If collecting entries interactively, ask one field at a time and wait for responses.
3. Review entries weekly to identify trends (sleep onset latency, awakenings, total sleep time).
4. Summarize patterns and suggest next steps (e.g., CBT-I targets, sleep hygiene).

## Clinical Workflow

1. **Start diary** for 1-2 weeks
2. **Review patterns** (bedtime, wake time, total sleep time, awakenings)
3. **Adjust treatment** (CBT-I, sleep hygiene, medical evaluation)
4. **Continue tracking** for response
