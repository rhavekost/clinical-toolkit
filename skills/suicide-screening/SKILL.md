# Suicide Risk Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated suicide risk screening instruments. The ASQ provides a brief initial screening, while the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) offers comprehensive assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify individuals at risk for suicide, assess severity of suicidal thinking, and guide clinical decision-making about safety interventions. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive suicide risk assessment and clinical judgment.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**ANY positive suicide screen requires IMMEDIATE action. DO NOT leave patient alone. Comprehensive risk assessment and safety planning required before patient leaves your care.**

**Universal crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Quick Reference

### Assessment Comparison

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | When Positive | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **ASQ** | 4 (+1 acuity) | 20 sec | Brief screening | Any "yes" | Quick triage, medical settings |
| **C-SSRS** | Multiple sections | 5-15 min | Comprehensive assessment | Determines risk level | Full assessment, positive ASQ |

**For detailed comparison:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)

### Risk Level Quick Reference

| Risk Level | Ideation | Plan/Intent | Behavior | Immediate Action |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Low** | Passive or none | None | None recent | Safety plan, 1-week follow-up |
| **Moderate** | Active, vague | Uncertain | Past attempt (not recent) | Same-day eval, intensive monitoring |
| **High** | Active, specific | Intent present | Recent attempt/preparatory | Psychiatric hospitalization likely |
| **Imminent** | Active, immediate | Has means, immediate intent | Attempt in progress | Call 911, emergency hospitalization |

**For detailed risk levels:** See [references/risk-levels.md](references/risk-levels.md)

## Assessment Tools

### ASQ (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions)

**Complete assessment with questions and protocol:**
→ [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **4 questions** + 1 acuity question if positive
- **Time:** 20 seconds
- **Any "yes" = positive screen** → Requires comprehensive assessment
- **Developed by:** NIMH for medical settings
- **Validated:** Ages 10+, high sensitivity

**The 4 Questions:**
1. Wished you were dead (past few weeks)?
2. Family better off if you were dead (past few weeks)?
3. Thoughts of killing yourself (past week)?
4. Ever tried to kill yourself? (If yes, when?)

**If any "yes" → Ask acuity:** "Thoughts of killing yourself right now?"

### C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale)

**Complete assessment with all sections:**
→ [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **Multiple sections:** Ideation, intensity, behavior
- **Time:** 5-15 minutes
- **Ideation severity:** 0-5 scale (passive thoughts → plan with intent)
- **Assesses behavior:** Attempts, preparatory acts
- **Determines risk level** when combined with clinical judgment

**What it assesses:**
- Suicidal ideation (severity 0-5)
- Intensity (frequency, duration, control)
- Suicidal behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)
- Timeline (lifetime + recent)

## Clinical Workflow

### 1. Choose Assessment

```
Very brief screening needed (20 seconds)?
  → Use ASQ
  → If positive → C-SSRS for full assessment

Comprehensive assessment needed (5-15 minutes)?
  → Use C-SSRS directly

Already did PHQ-9 with positive Item 9?
  → Can use ASQ or go directly to C-SSRS
```

### 2. Administer Assessment

**ASQ:** [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md) - 4 questions, 20 seconds
**C-SSRS:** [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md) - Multiple sections, 5-15 minutes

### 3. Determine Risk Level

**Use comprehensive protocol:**
→ [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)

**Integrate:**
- Ideation (presence, frequency, intensity)
- Plan and intent (specificity, access to means)
- Behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)
- Protective factors
- Risk factors
- Mental status

**Risk levels:** See [references/risk-levels.md](references/risk-levels.md)

### 4. Immediate Safety Interventions

**ALL risk levels:**
- Create safety plan (see [references/safety-planning.md](references/safety-planning.md))
- Provide crisis resources
- Remove means when possible
- Document thoroughly

**Moderate-High risk:**
- Same-day psychiatric evaluation
- Intensive monitoring
- Remove ALL lethal means
- Involve support system

**High-Imminent risk:**
- Call 911 or crisis team
- DO NOT leave alone
- Emergency hospitalization

### 5. Document

**Use documentation templates in:**
- [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md#documentation-template)
- [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md#documentation-template)
- [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md#documentation)

**Documentation standards:** [../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md](../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### ANY Positive Response Requires:

1. **DO NOT leave patient alone** - Ever
2. **Comprehensive assessment** - Not just screening
3. **Assess plan, intent, means** - Specific details critical
4. **Remove lethal means** - Firearms, medications, etc.
5. **Determine risk level** - Low/Moderate/High/Imminent
6. **Intervene appropriately** - Based on risk level
7. **Document thoroughly** - Everything
8. **Ensure continuous safety** - Until secured

### Immediate Questions After Positive Screen:

**Essential assessment:**
- "Do you have a plan?" (If yes: What exactly?)
- "Do you have access to [method]?" (Means assessment)
- "Do you intend to act on these thoughts?"
- "When are you thinking about doing this?"
- "What's kept you safe so far?"
- "Have you attempted before?" (When? How? What happened?)

**See complete protocol:** [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)

### Crisis Resources - Provide to ALL Patients

**Always give crisis resources:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text 988, 24/7)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
- **Veterans Crisis Line:** Call 988 then press 1, or text 838255
- **Trevor Project** (LGBTQ+ youth): 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678678
- **Emergency:** 911

### Safety Planning

**Required for all risk levels:**
See complete guide: [references/safety-planning.md](references/safety-planning.md)

**Essential elements:**
1. Warning signs (personal indicators of crisis)
2. Internal coping strategies (self-soothing)
3. People/places for distraction
4. People to call for help
5. Professionals/crisis services to contact
6. Make environment safe (means restriction)
7. Reasons for living

### Means Restriction

**CRITICAL intervention - saves lives:**

**Firearms (most lethal):**
- Remove from home completely (preferred)
- If must remain: Locked, someone else controls key/combo
- Ammunition stored separately

**Medications:**
- Remove excess medications
- Give to family member or pharmacy
- Weekly dispensing only

**Other means:**
- Based on patient's specific plan
- Remove ropes, cords, chemicals as indicated

**See details:** [references/safety-planning.md](references/safety-planning.md#step-6-make-the-environment-safe)

### NEVER:

- Leave suicidal patient alone
- Assume someone else will handle it
- Accept "I'm fine" without full assessment
- Discharge without safety plan
- Minimize or dismiss suicidal statements
- Skip means restriction
- Use "no-suicide contracts" (not evidence-based)

## Special Considerations

### Special Populations

**Adolescents:**
- Higher impulsivity
- Peer influence, bullying, social media
- Involve parents (balance with privacy)
- School notification may be needed

**LGBTQ+ Individuals:**
- Higher risk (minority stress, discrimination)
- Family acceptance is protective
- Trevor Project resources

**Veterans:**
- Combat trauma, PTSD
- Access to firearms common
- Veterans Crisis Line
- VA mental health services

**Older Adults:**
- Medical illness, loss, isolation
- Higher lethality of attempts
- Don't avoid asking due to age

**Post-Discharge:**
- Highest risk: First weeks after psychiatric hospitalization
- Close follow-up essential
- Safety plan review

### Co-occurring Conditions

**Screen for suicidal ideation when:**
- Severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥15)
- Psychosis
- Substance use disorder
- PTSD
- Chronic pain
- Terminal illness
- Recent significant loss

**Use PHQ-9 Item 9 alongside:** See [../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md](../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md)

### Cultural Considerations

- Ask directly across all cultures
- Expression of suicidal thoughts varies
- Religious/cultural beliefs may affect disclosure
- Use interpreters when needed
- Understand cultural protective factors

## Referral Guidelines

### When to Refer/Hospitalize

**Immediate (Emergency Services/911):**
- Imminent risk (plan, intent, means, immediate)
- Attempt in progress
- Cannot keep self safe
- Psychosis with command hallucinations

**Urgent (Same-Day Psychiatric Evaluation):**
- High risk (plan and intent but not imminent)
- Moderate risk unable to safety plan
- Recent attempt (past week)

**Routine (Within 1-3 Days):**
- Low risk needing mental health treatment
- Moderate risk with good safety plan
- Follow-up after higher level of care

**Complete referral guidance:** [../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md](../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md)

## Limitations

**Suicide screening tools have limitations:**
- Cannot predict suicide with certainty
- Patient may not disclose
- Risk changes rapidly
- Tools support but don't replace clinical judgment
- Negative screen doesn't mean no risk

**Clinical judgment essential:**
- When in doubt, assess more thoroughly
- Consult when uncertain
- Err on side of safety
- Trust your clinical intuition

## Usage Examples

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for suicide risk in any setting
- Assess severity of suicidal ideation
- Determine appropriate level of care
- Create safety plans
- Document suicide risk assessment

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for suicide risk"
- "Patient screened positive on ASQ - what now?"
- "Guide me through C-SSRS administration"
- "How do I create a safety plan?"
- "Patient has suicidal thoughts - how do I assess risk level?"
