# Suicide Risk Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated suicide risk screening instruments. The ASQ provides a brief initial screening, while the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) offers comprehensive assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify individuals at risk for suicide, assess severity of suicidal thinking, and guide clinical decision-making about safety interventions. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive suicide risk assessment and clinical judgment.

## Available Assessments

| Assessment | Items | Purpose | Cutoffs | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **ASQ** | 4-5 | Brief suicide screening | Any "yes" is positive | NIMH Ask Suicide-Screening Questions |
| **C-SSRS Screener** | 6 | Suicide risk assessment | Assesses ideation severity + behavior | Columbia Protocol |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for suicide risk
- Assess severity of suicidal thinking
- Evaluate recent suicidal behavior
- Determine appropriate level of intervention
- Document suicide risk assessment

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for suicide risk"
- "I need to administer the C-SSRS"
- "Can you guide me through a suicide risk assessment?"
- "How do I interpret these suicide screening results?"

## Administration & Scoring

### ASQ (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions)

**Key Facts:**
- 4 yes/no questions, with optional 5th acuity question
- Any "yes" answer to questions 1-4 is a positive screen
- Takes <20 seconds to administer
- Developed by NIMH for use in medical settings
- High sensitivity for identifying suicide risk
- Question 5 (acuity) asked only if screen is positive

### C-SSRS Screener (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale)

**Key Facts:**
- Assesses both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior
- Distinguishes ideation severity (wish to die vs. active intent with plan)
- Identifies recent suicidal behavior
- Evidence-based, widely used in research and clinical settings
- Columbia University, freely available with attribution
- Multiple versions available (screening, full assessment, brief)

**Two key dimensions:**
1. **Severity of Ideation** - From passive thoughts to active intent with specific plan
2. **Suicidal Behavior** - Actual attempts, aborted attempts, preparatory acts

*[Full instrument items, scoring algorithm, and interpretation to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Detailed interpretation guidelines for risk levels, clinical significance, and next steps to be added]*

**Risk Stratification:**
- **Low Risk:** Passive thoughts, no intent, no plan, no behavior
- **Moderate Risk:** Active ideation without specific plan or intent
- **High Risk:** Active ideation with plan and/or intent
- **Imminent Risk:** Active plan with intent and means, or recent attempt

**Clinical Decision Points:**
- Passive ideation: Outpatient safety planning, close follow-up
- Active ideation: Same-day evaluation, consider hospitalization
- Plan + intent: Strong consideration for hospitalization
- Recent attempt: Typically requires emergency/inpatient care

## Safety Protocols

**⚠️ CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR POSITIVE SCREENS:**

### Any Positive Response Requires:
1. **DO NOT leave patient alone**
2. **Immediate direct clinical evaluation** - Cannot defer or postpone
3. **Assess means, intent, and plan** - Specific details matter
4. **Remove access to lethal means** - Medications, firearms, etc.
5. **Determine level of care needed** - Outpatient safety plan vs. emergency services
6. **Document thoroughly** - Assessment, interventions, disposition
7. **Ensure continuous safety** - Until appropriate care level is secured

### Essential Follow-Up Questions:
- How often have you had these thoughts?
- When was the most recent time?
- Do you have a plan? (If yes: What is it?)
- Do you have access to means? (medications, firearms, etc.)
- Do you intend to act on these thoughts?
- What has kept you safe so far?
- Have you attempted suicide before?

### Immediate Interventions:
- **High/Imminent Risk:** Call 911, mobile crisis, or transport to emergency department
- **Moderate Risk:** Same-day psychiatric evaluation, safety planning, remove means
- **Lower Risk:** Safety planning, means restriction counseling, scheduled follow-up (within 24-48 hours)

### Crisis Resources (Provide to ALL patients screened):
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 (24/7, free, confidential)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
- **Veterans Crisis Line:** 988 then Press 1
- **Emergency Services:** 911

### Safety Planning Elements:
- Warning signs recognition
- Internal coping strategies
- People and social settings that provide distraction
- People to ask for help
- Professionals or agencies to contact during crisis
- Making environment safe (means restriction)

**NEVER:**
- Leave a suicidal patient alone or unsupervised
- Assume someone else will handle it
- Accept "I'm fine" without thorough assessment
- Discharge without safety plan if any risk identified
- Minimize or dismiss suicidal statements

*[Detailed safety protocols and escalation pathways to be added]*

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not sufficient for complete risk assessment:**
- Does not replace comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Cannot predict suicide with certainty
- Risk is dynamic and can change rapidly
- Requires interpretation within full clinical context
- Some individuals may minimize or deny risk
- Clinical judgment and ongoing monitoring essential

**Assessment Considerations:**
- Create safe, non-judgmental environment
- Ask questions directly and matter-of-factly
- Assess protective factors (reasons for living, social support)
- Evaluate co-occurring conditions (depression, substance use, psychosis)
- Consider recent stressors and losses
- Assess access to lethal means
- Cultural factors in expressing distress
- Prior suicide attempts are strongest predictor

**Special Populations:**
- **Adolescents:** Impulsivity, peer influence, bullying
- **LGBTQ+ individuals:** Higher risk, discrimination, rejection
- **Veterans:** Access to lethal means, combat trauma, transitions
- **Older adults:** Physical illness, isolation, loss
- **Individuals with chronic pain:** Suffering, hopelessness
- **Post-discharge:** Highest risk period after psychiatric hospitalization
