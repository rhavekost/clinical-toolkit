# Distress Screening (K6 / K10)

## Description

This skill provides the K6 and K10 psychological distress scales. Use K6 for brief screening and K10 for more detailed monitoring.

**Permission:** Use of K6 and K10 is free and does not require formal permission; include the required copyright and citation.

## Quick Reference

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Score Range |
|------------|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **K6** | 6 | 1-2 min | Brief distress screening | 0-24 (0-4 coding) |
| **K10** | 10 | 2-3 min | Distress monitoring | 0-40 (0-4 coding) |

## Assessment Tools

- **K6**: [assets/k6.md](assets/k6.md)
- **K10**: [assets/k10.md](assets/k10.md)

## Interactive Administration (Optional)

Use this mode when the clinician says "start" or "administer" the K6/K10.

1. Confirm readiness and explain the past 30 days time frame plus the 5-point response scale.
2. Ask one item at a time (verbatim from the asset file) and wait for a response before continuing.
3. Accept numeric or verbal responses; if unclear or out of range, ask for clarification.
4. Recode responses to 0-4 scoring and keep a running total.
5. After the final item, calculate the total score, interpret severity, and provide next-step guidance.
6. Offer a brief documentation summary if requested.

## Documentation

Use templates in each asset file.
