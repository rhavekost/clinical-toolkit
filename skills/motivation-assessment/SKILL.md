# Motivation Assessment

## Description

This skill provides tools to assess readiness to change and tailor interventions accordingly. Use the brief readiness ruler for fast assessment and URICA access guidance for a more comprehensive profile.

## Quick Reference

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Output | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Readiness Ruler** | 1-3 | <1 min | Rapid stage estimate | 0-10 rating | Quick triage, routine visits |
| **URICA (access guidance)** | 32 | 5-10 min | Detailed readiness profile | Stage scores | Treatment planning, complex cases |

## Interactive Administration (Optional)

Use this mode when the clinician says "start" or "administer" readiness screening.

1. **Readiness Ruler:** Ask the 0-10 rating(s) (importance, confidence, readiness) and record scores.
2. **URICA:** Use the official form and scoring guidance; have the patient complete it, then record 1-5 responses and compute stage scores.
3. Summarize the stage profile, identify the dominant stage, and offer stage-matched guidance.

## Clinical Workflow

1. **Select tool** (brief vs comprehensive)
2. **Administer** readiness ruler or URICA
3. **Score** and identify dominant stage
4. **Match intervention** to readiness level
