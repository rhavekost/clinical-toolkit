# Anxiety Screening Comparison

Guide for choosing between GAD-2 and GAD-7 screening tools.

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Need for anxiety screening identified
    ↓
Time-limited setting (primary care, ER, brief encounter)?
    ↓ YES → Start with GAD-2
    ↓ NO → Use GAD-7 for comprehensive assessment
    ↓
GAD-2 score ≥3?
    ↓ YES → Administer full GAD-7
    ↓ NO → Negative screen, monitor and reassess as needed
```

## When to Use GAD-2

**Ideal Settings:**
- Primary care routine screening
- Emergency department visits
- Urgent care
- Annual wellness visits
- Large-scale screening programs
- Time-limited encounters

**Advantages:**
- Very brief (< 1 minute)
- High sensitivity for anxiety disorders
- Easy to administer
- Minimal patient burden
- Good for initial screening in busy settings

**Limitations:**
- Only a screener, not diagnostic
- Positive screen requires full GAD-7
- Does not assess severity
- Less useful for monitoring treatment response

**Interpretation:**
- Score 0-2: Negative screen (anxiety disorder unlikely)
- Score ≥3: Positive screen (administer GAD-7)

## When to Use GAD-7

**Ideal Settings:**
- Mental health specialty settings
- Diagnostic assessments
- Treatment monitoring
- When time permits comprehensive screening
- Follow-up after positive GAD-2

**Advantages:**
- Comprehensive anxiety assessment
- Severity rating (minimal, mild, moderate, severe)
- Validated for multiple anxiety disorders (not just GAD)
- Can track change over time
- Good psychometric properties

**Limitations:**
- Takes 2-3 minutes (longer than GAD-2)
- May be too long for very brief encounters
- Screens for anxiety generally, not specific disorder

**Interpretation:**
- Score 0-4: Minimal anxiety
- Score 5-9: Mild anxiety
- Score 10-14: Moderate anxiety
- Score 15-21: Severe anxiety

## Two-Stage Screening Approach

### Stage 1: GAD-2 (Universal Screening)

Administer GAD-2 to all patients during routine visits.

**If score 0-2:**
- Negative screen
- No further anxiety screening needed at this time
- Reassess at next visit or if symptoms emerge

**If score ≥3:**
- Positive screen
- Proceed to Stage 2

### Stage 2: GAD-7 (Comprehensive Assessment)

Administer full GAD-7 when GAD-2 is positive.

**Benefits of two-stage approach:**
- Efficient use of time (most patients complete only GAD-2)
- High sensitivity maintained
- Reduces screening burden
- Focuses detailed assessment on those who need it

## When to Skip GAD-2 and Go Straight to GAD-7

**Use GAD-7 directly when:**
- Patient presents specifically for anxiety evaluation
- Anxiety already suspected based on presentation
- Monitoring established anxiety diagnosis
- Time is not a significant constraint
- Comprehensive assessment needed for treatment planning
- Need baseline severity for treatment monitoring

**Example scenarios for direct GAD-7:**
- "I can't stop worrying" (chief complaint)
- Follow-up for known anxiety disorder
- Mental health intake assessment
- Medication management visit
- Therapy session with anxiety focus

## Monitoring Treatment Response

### Use GAD-7 for Treatment Monitoring

**Initial Assessment:**
- Administer GAD-7 to establish baseline severity

**Follow-up:**
- Readminister GAD-7 at regular intervals (every 2-4 weeks typically)
- Track score changes over time
- 5-point decrease = meaningful treatment response
- Goal: Score <10 (below moderate threshold) or <5 (minimal)

**Do NOT use GAD-2 for treatment monitoring:**
- GAD-2 does not assess severity
- Cannot track meaningful change
- Insufficient detail for treatment decisions

## Frequency of Screening

### General Population (No Anxiety History)

**GAD-2:**
- Annual screening during wellness visits
- Or per organizational protocol

**GAD-7:**
- Only if GAD-2 positive
- Or if symptoms emerge between screenings

### Patients with Anxiety History

**During Active Treatment:**
- GAD-7 every 2-4 weeks
- Monitor treatment response
- Adjust treatment based on scores

**After Remission:**
- GAD-7 every 3-6 months for first year
- Then annually or per clinical judgment
- Watch for relapse

### High-Risk Populations

**More frequent screening for:**
- Chronic medical illness
- History of anxiety or depression
- Recent major life stressor
- Chronic pain conditions
- Substance use disorders

**Frequency:**
- GAD-2 at every visit, or
- GAD-7 every 1-3 months

## Special Populations

### Primary Care Settings

**Recommendation:**
- Universal GAD-2 screening at annual visits
- GAD-7 for positive GAD-2 screens
- GAD-7 for anyone presenting with anxiety symptoms

### Emergency Department

**Recommendation:**
- GAD-2 for rapid screening if anxiety suspected
- GAD-7 if time permits and GAD-2 positive
- Focus on ruling out panic attacks, acute stress

### Mental Health Settings

**Recommendation:**
- GAD-7 at intake for all patients
- Repeat GAD-7 every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- GAD-2 generally not needed (sufficient time for full assessment)

### Medical Specialty Clinics

**Recommendation:**
- Consider GAD-2 or GAD-7 in cardiology, pulmonology, GI clinics
- Anxiety common in chronic medical conditions
- Screen to identify comorbid anxiety needing treatment

### Postpartum

**Recommendation:**
- Screen for postpartum anxiety (distinct from postpartum depression)
- GAD-7 appropriate
- Screen at postpartum visits (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months)

### Adolescents

**Recommendation:**
- GAD-7 validated in adolescents (ages 12+)
- Annual screening recommended
- Screen more often if risk factors present

### Older Adults

**Recommendation:**
- GAD-7 validated in older adults
- May need to account for medical comorbidity
- Anxiety often under-recognized in this population

## Comparison with Other Anxiety Measures

### GAD-7 vs. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)

**GAD-7 advantages:**
- Shorter (7 vs 21 items)
- Freely available (BAI requires purchase)
- Better for somatic symptoms related to medical illness

**BAI advantages:**
- More detailed assessment
- Well-established in research

**Recommendation:** GAD-7 for routine clinical use

### GAD-7 vs. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)

**GAD-7 advantages:**
- Self-report (faster)
- Freely available
- Validated in primary care

**HAM-A advantages:**
- Clinician-rated (may be more objective)
- Longer history in research

**Recommendation:** GAD-7 for routine screening, HAM-A for specialized research

### GAD-7 vs. Disorder-Specific Measures

**For specific anxiety disorders, consider:**
- **Panic:** Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)
- **Social Anxiety:** Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN)
- **OCD:** Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)
- **PTSD:** PCL-5 (see trauma-screening skill)

**GAD-7 is good general screener but specific measures needed for detailed assessment**

## Combined Depression and Anxiety Screening

### GAD-7 + PHQ-9 = Common Approach

**Why combine:**
- Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur
- Efficient to screen both
- Informs treatment approach

**Workflow:**
1. Administer GAD-2 + PHQ-2 for rapid screening
2. If either positive, administer full GAD-7 + PHQ-9
3. Use combined scores to guide treatment

**Interpretation:**
- High GAD-7 only: Primarily anxiety
- High PHQ-9 only: Primarily depression
- Both high: Co-occurring (very common)
- Both low: Minimal symptoms

## Documentation

### GAD-2 Documentation

```
GAD-2 administered [date]: Score [0-6]
- Item 1 (nervous/anxious): [0-3]
- Item 2 (can't control worry): [0-3]
Result: [Negative screen / Positive screen]
Plan: [If positive, will administer GAD-7]
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use just the first 2 items of the GAD-7 as a GAD-2?**
A: Yes, the GAD-2 consists of the first two items of the GAD-7.

**Q: If I'm already giving the GAD-7, do I need to score the GAD-2 separately?**
A: No, not necessary. The full GAD-7 includes all the information from the GAD-2 and more.

**Q: Can I diagnose an anxiety disorder based on GAD scores alone?**
A: No. GAD-2 and GAD-7 are screening tools. Diagnosis requires clinical interview and judgment.

**Q: What if GAD-2 is negative but I still suspect anxiety?**
A: Trust your clinical judgment. Administer GAD-7 if clinical concern remains despite negative GAD-2.

**Q: Does a high GAD-7 mean the patient has Generalized Anxiety Disorder?**
A: Not necessarily. GAD-7 screens for anxiety generally. High scores can indicate GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety, PTSD, or other anxiety conditions. Further assessment needed for specific diagnosis.

## Psychometric Properties

### GAD-7 Validation Data

**Diagnostic Accuracy:**
- **Optimal cutoff:** Score of 8 (balances sensitivity and specificity)
- **Sensitivity:** 92% for generalized anxiety disorder (at cutoff of 8)
- **Specificity:** 76% for generalized anxiety disorder (at cutoff of 8)
- Cutoff of 10 commonly used in practice (higher specificity, adequate sensitivity)

**Cross-Disorder Screening:**
- Screens reasonably well for multiple anxiety disorders:
  - Panic disorder
  - Social anxiety disorder
  - PTSD (though disorder-specific tools preferred)
- Not limited to generalized anxiety disorder despite the name

**Reliability:**
- **Internal consistency:** Excellent across multiple studies
- Test-retest reliability well-established

**Treatment Monitoring:**
- **Meaningful change:** 5-point decrease indicates treatment response
- Sensitive to symptom changes during treatment
- Goal: Reduction to <10 (below moderate threshold) or <5 (minimal symptoms)

**Development:**
- Created by same research team as PHQ-9 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams)
- Parallel design facilitates combined depression-anxiety screening

### GAD-2 Validation Data

**Diagnostic Accuracy:**
- Optimized for sensitivity to minimize missed cases
- Positive screen (≥3) requires full GAD-7 for specificity

**Efficiency:**
- Reduces screening burden when combined with GAD-7
- Two-stage approach maintains high sensitivity with better efficiency
