# Anxiety Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated anxiety screening instruments. The GAD-2 serves as a brief initial screener, while the GAD-7 provides comprehensive assessment of generalized anxiety severity.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help quantify anxiety symptoms, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. The GAD-7 also screens reasonably well for panic disorder, social anxiety, and PTSD. These are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive clinical evaluation.

## Quick Reference

### Assessment Comparison

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Cutoff | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **GAD-2** | 2 | <1 min | Brief screening | ≥3 → Full GAD-7 | Time-limited settings, universal screening |
| **GAD-7** | 7 | 2-3 min | Severity assessment | ≥10 = Moderate+ | Comprehensive assessment, treatment monitoring |

**For detailed comparison:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)

### GAD-7 Severity Levels

| Score | Severity | First-Line Treatment | Follow-up |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 0-4 | Minimal | Monitor, psychoeducation | Annual or as needed |
| 5-9 | Mild | Relaxation/stress management | 2-4 weeks |
| 10-14 | Moderate | Therapy or medication | 2-4 weeks |
| 15-21 | Severe | Combination therapy, specialty referral | 1-2 weeks |

**For detailed severity interpretations:** See [references/severity-levels.md](references/severity-levels.md)

**For treatment recommendations:** See [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

## Assessment Tools

### GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7)

**Complete assessment with items, scoring, and documentation:**
→ [assets/gad-7.md](assets/gad-7.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **7 items**, 0-3 scale each, total score 0-21
- **Cutoff ≥10:** 89% sensitivity/82% specificity for GAD
- **5-point change:** Indicates treatment response
- **Validated** for screening GAD, panic, social anxiety, PTSD
- **Does NOT:** Include safety item (screen for suicidal ideation with PHQ-9 if needed)

### GAD-2 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2)

**Complete assessment with items, scoring, and documentation:**
→ [assets/gad-2.md](assets/gad-2.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **2 items** (first 2 from GAD-7), 0-3 scale each, total score 0-6
- **Cutoff ≥3:** Positive screen → administer full GAD-7
- **Use for:** Rapid screening, universal screening in time-limited settings
- **Does NOT:** Assess severity or screen for suicidal ideation

**When to use GAD-2 vs GAD-7:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)

## Clinical Workflow

### 1. Choose Assessment

```
Time-limited encounter (primary care, ER)?
  → Use GAD-2 first
  → If score ≥3, give GAD-7

Mental health setting or treatment monitoring?
  → Use GAD-7 directly

Anxiety already suspected?
  → Use GAD-7 directly
```

### 2. Administer Assessment

**GAD-2:** [assets/gad-2.md](assets/gad-2.md) - 2 items, <1 minute
**GAD-7:** [assets/gad-7.md](assets/gad-7.md) - 7 items, 2-3 minutes

### 3. Score and Interpret

**Scoring:**
- Sum all item responses
- GAD-2: 0-6 range
- GAD-7: 0-21 range

**Interpretation:**
- See quick reference table above
- Detailed interpretations: [references/severity-levels.md](references/severity-levels.md)

### 4. Clinical Decision-Making

**Follow clinical decision trees:** [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

**General pathways:**
- **GAD-7 0-4:** Monitor, psychoeducation
- **GAD-7 5-9:** Relaxation techniques, stress management, watchful waiting
- **GAD-7 10-14:** Active treatment (CBT or medication)
- **GAD-7 15-21:** Combination therapy, specialty referral

### 5. Document

**Use documentation templates in:**
- [assets/gad-2.md](assets/gad-2.md#documentation-template)
- [assets/gad-7.md](assets/gad-7.md#documentation-template)

**Documentation standards:** [../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md](../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md)

## Treatment Monitoring

**Use GAD-7 to track progress:**
- **Baseline:** Administer at treatment start
- **Follow-up:** Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- **Response indicators:**
  - <5-point decrease: Minimal response (consider treatment change)
  - 5-9 point decrease: Partial response (continue, monitor)
  - ≥5-point decrease AND score <10: Good response
  - Score <5: Remission (treatment goal)

**Do NOT use GAD-2 for treatment monitoring** - insufficient detail

## Safety Considerations

### GAD-7 Does NOT Screen for Suicidal Ideation

**Important:** Unlike PHQ-9, GAD-7 has no safety item

**When to assess suicidal ideation:**
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 ≥15)
- Co-occurring depression
- Any clinical concern

**How to assess:**
- Administer PHQ-9 (includes Item 9 for suicidal ideation)
- Direct clinical questioning
- See [../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md](../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md)

**Always assess:**
- Panic attacks and their impact
- Avoidance behaviors affecting functioning
- Substance use (especially self-medication)
- Co-occurring depression (administer PHQ-9)

**Crisis Resources:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
- **Emergency:** 911

**Universal crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Special Considerations

### Differential Diagnosis

**High GAD-7 may indicate:**
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Panic Disorder (assess for panic attacks)
- Social Anxiety Disorder (assess for social fears)
- PTSD (assess trauma history)
- Health Anxiety
- OCD (assess for obsessions/compulsions)

**Further assessment needed for specific diagnosis**

### Medical Causes

**Rule out medical conditions:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Respiratory conditions
- Caffeine/substance use
- Medication side effects

### Co-occurring Depression

**Very common (60% overlap):**
- Administer both GAD-7 and PHQ-9
- Integrated treatment for both
- Monitor both conditions

### Substance Use

- May be self-medication for anxiety
- Substances can worsen anxiety
- Withdrawal causes anxiety
- Address both concurrently

### Cultural Factors

- Expression of anxiety varies across cultures
- Use culturally validated versions when available
- Consider language and health literacy

### Age Considerations

- **Adolescents:** GAD-7 validated in teens (ages 12+)
- **Older adults:** GAD-7 validated, account for medical comorbidity
- **Children <12:** Different screening tools recommended

## Referral Guidelines

### When to Refer to Specialty Mental Health

**Immediate/Urgent:**
- GAD-7 ≥15 at initial presentation
- Severe functional impairment
- Inadequate response to initial treatment
- Patient request for specialty care

**Routine:**
- GAD-7 10-14 if patient prefers specialist
- Complex presentation (trauma, substance use)
- Need for specialized anxiety treatment (exposure therapy, etc.)

**Complete referral guidance:** [../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md](../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md)

## Limitations

**GAD-2 and GAD-7 are screening tools, not diagnostic instruments:**
- Do not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- Require interpretation within clinical context
- Do not differentiate between specific anxiety disorders
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores
- Cannot diagnose based on score alone

**Potential issues:**
- False positives (medical conditions, substances)
- False negatives (patient minimization)
- Cultural/linguistic factors affect responses
- Requires patient insight and honest reporting

## Usage Examples

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen a patient for anxiety symptoms
- Assess anxiety severity for treatment planning
- Track treatment response over time
- Determine appropriate level of care
- Screen for panic disorder, social anxiety, or PTSD

**Example requests:**
- "Help me administer a GAD-7"
- "I need to screen this patient for anxiety"
- "Score this GAD-7 and interpret results"
- "What treatment is recommended for GAD-7 score of 17?"
- "Should I screen for anxiety and depression together?"
