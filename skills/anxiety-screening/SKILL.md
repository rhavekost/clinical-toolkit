# Anxiety Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated anxiety screening instruments. The GAD-2 serves as a brief initial screener, while the GAD-7 provides comprehensive assessment of generalized anxiety severity.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help quantify anxiety symptoms, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. The GAD-7 also screens reasonably well for panic disorder, social anxiety, and PTSD. These are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive clinical evaluation.

## Available Assessments

| Assessment | Items | Purpose | Cutoffs | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **GAD-7** | 7 | Anxiety severity assessment | 5/10/15 (mild/moderate/severe) | Also screens for panic, social anxiety, PTSD |
| **GAD-2** | 2 | Brief anxiety screening | ≥3 triggers full GAD-7 | First 2 items of GAD-7 |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen a patient for anxiety symptoms
- Assess generalized anxiety severity
- Track treatment response over time
- Quantify symptom changes
- Screen for panic or social anxiety

**Example requests:**
- "Help me administer a GAD-7"
- "I need to screen this patient for anxiety"
- "Can you score this GAD-7 for me?"
- "Interpret these anxiety screening results"

## Administration & Scoring

### GAD-7 (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale)

**Key Facts:**
- Cutoff of 8 optimizes sensitivity (92%) and specificity (76%)
- Cutoff of 10 balances sensitivity and specificity for GAD
- Also screens reasonably well for panic disorder, social anxiety, and PTSD
- Same developers as PHQ-9 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams)
- 5-point change indicates clinically significant improvement

### GAD-2 (2-item Anxiety Screener)

**Key Facts:**
- Ultra-brief screener using first 2 items of GAD-7
- Score ≥3 indicates positive screen, triggers full GAD-7
- High sensitivity for identifying anxiety disorders

*[Full instrument items, scoring algorithm, and interpretation to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Detailed interpretation guidelines for score ranges, clinical significance, and next steps to be added]*

**Score Ranges:**
- 0-4: Minimal anxiety
- 5-9: Mild anxiety
- 10-14: Moderate anxiety
- 15-21: Severe anxiety

**Clinical Considerations:**
- Scores ≥10 suggest clinically significant anxiety
- Consider specific anxiety disorder assessment if screen is positive
- Monitor for comorbid depression (consider PHQ-9)
- Assess functional impairment

## Safety Protocols

**While the GAD-7 does not have specific safety items like PHQ-9, always assess:**
- Suicidal ideation if severe anxiety or depression is present
- Panic attacks and their impact on functioning
- Avoidance behaviors affecting daily life
- Use of substances to manage anxiety

*[Detailed safety considerations and escalation pathways to be added]*

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- Requires interpretation within clinical context
- Does not differentiate between specific anxiety disorders
- Cultural and linguistic considerations affect responses
- Medical conditions can cause anxiety symptoms
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Expression of anxiety varies across cultures
- Somatic symptoms may be more or less prominent
- Consider using culturally validated versions when available
- Language and health literacy affect comprehension

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
