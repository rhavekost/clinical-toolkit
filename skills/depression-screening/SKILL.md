# Depression Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated depression screening instruments. The PHQ-2 serves as a brief initial screener, while the PHQ-9 provides comprehensive assessment of depression severity aligned with DSM criteria.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help quantify depression symptoms, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive clinical evaluation.

## Available Assessments

| Assessment | Items | Purpose | Cutoffs | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **PHQ-9** | 9 | Depression severity assessment | 5/10/15/20 (mild/moderate/moderately severe/severe) | Item 9 screens for suicidal ideation |
| **PHQ-2** | 2 | Brief depression screening | ≥3 triggers full PHQ-9 | First 2 items of PHQ-9 |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen a patient for depression symptoms
- Assess depression severity
- Track treatment response over time
- Quantify symptom changes

**Example requests:**
- "Help me administer a PHQ-9"
- "I need to screen this patient for depression"
- "Can you score this PHQ-9 for me?"
- "Interpret these depression screening results"

## Administration & Scoring

### PHQ-9 (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire)

**Key Facts:**
- 88% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression at cutoff of 10
- Item 9 screens for suicidal ideation - ANY positive response requires follow-up
- 5-point change indicates treatment response
- 10-point change indicates clinically significant improvement
- Cronbach's α = 0.89 (excellent internal consistency)

### PHQ-2 (2-item Depression Screener)

**Key Facts:**
- Ultra-brief screener using first 2 items of PHQ-9
- Score ≥3 indicates positive screen, triggers full PHQ-9
- High sensitivity, useful for time-limited settings

*[Full instrument items, scoring algorithm, and interpretation to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Detailed interpretation guidelines for score ranges, clinical significance, and next steps to be added]*

**Score Ranges:**
- 0-4: Minimal depression
- 5-9: Mild depression
- 10-14: Moderate depression
- 15-19: Moderately severe depression
- 20-27: Severe depression

## Safety Protocols

**⚠️ CRITICAL - PHQ-9 Item 9 (Suicidal Ideation):**

Item 9 asks about thoughts of self-harm or suicide. ANY positive response (score > 0) requires:
1. Immediate clinical follow-up
2. Direct safety assessment
3. Never defer or postpone evaluation
4. Document assessment and interventions

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- Requires interpretation within clinical context
- Cultural and linguistic considerations affect responses
- Physical illness can elevate somatic symptom scores
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Expression of depression varies across cultures
- Somatic symptoms may be more prominent in some populations
- Consider using culturally validated versions when available
- Language and health literacy affect comprehension

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
