# Depression Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated depression screening instruments. The PHQ-2 serves as a brief initial screener, while the PHQ-9 provides comprehensive assessment of depression severity aligned with DSM criteria.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help quantify depression symptoms, track treatment response, and support clinical decision-making. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive clinical evaluation.

## Quick Reference

### Assessment Comparison

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Cutoff | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **PHQ-2** | 2 | <1 min | Brief screening | ≥3 → Full PHQ-9 | Time-limited settings, universal screening |
| **PHQ-9** | 9 | 2-3 min | Severity assessment | ≥10 = Moderate+ | Comprehensive assessment, treatment monitoring |

**For detailed comparison:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)

### PHQ-9 Severity Levels

| Score | Severity | First-Line Treatment | Follow-up |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 0-4 | Minimal | Monitor, psychoeducation | Annual or as needed |
| 5-9 | Mild | Behavioral interventions | 2-4 weeks |
| 10-14 | Moderate | Therapy or medication | 2-4 weeks |
| 15-19 | Moderately Severe | Combination therapy, specialty referral | 1-2 weeks |
| 20-27 | Severe | Specialty referral, higher level of care | Weekly+ |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

### PHQ-9 Item 9: Suicidal Ideation

**Item 9:** "Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way"

**ANY score > 0 on Item 9 requires IMMEDIATE action:**
1. **Stop** and address immediately - do not wait until end of assessment
2. **Assess** safety fully (ideation, plan, intent, means, protective factors)
3. **Intervene** based on risk level (safety plan, crisis resources, emergency evaluation)
4. **Document** thoroughly

**See detailed protocol:** [references/item-9-safety-protocol.md](references/item-9-safety-protocol.md)

**Crisis Resources:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
- **Emergency:** 911

**Universal crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Assessment Tools

### PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)

**Complete assessment with items, scoring, and documentation:**
→ [assets/phq-9.md](assets/phq-9.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **9 items**, 0-3 scale each, total score 0-27
- **Cutoff ≥10:** 88% sensitivity/specificity for major depression
- **Item 9:** Screens for suicidal ideation - requires immediate follow-up if positive
- **Treatment response:** 5-point decrease = response, 10-point = clinically significant
- **Validated** for screening, diagnosis support, and treatment monitoring

### PHQ-2 (Patient Health Questionnaire-2)

**Complete assessment with items, scoring, and documentation:**
→ [assets/phq-2.md](assets/phq-2.md)

**Key Facts:**
- **2 items** (first 2 from PHQ-9), 0-3 scale each, total score 0-6
- **Cutoff ≥3:** Positive screen → administer full PHQ-9
- **Use for:** Rapid screening, universal screening in time-limited settings
- **Does NOT:** Assess severity or include suicidal ideation screening

**When to use PHQ-2 vs PHQ-9:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)

## Clinical Workflow

### 1. Choose Assessment

```
Time-limited encounter (primary care, ER)?
  → Use PHQ-2 first
  → If score ≥3, give PHQ-9

Mental health setting or treatment monitoring?
  → Use PHQ-9 directly

Depression already suspected?
  → Use PHQ-9 directly
```

### 2. Administer Assessment

**PHQ-2:** [assets/phq-2.md](assets/phq-2.md) - 2 items, <1 minute
**PHQ-9:** [assets/phq-9.md](assets/phq-9.md) - 9 items, 2-3 minutes

### 3. Score and Interpret

**Scoring:**
- Sum all item responses
- PHQ-2: 0-6 range
- PHQ-9: 0-27 range

**Interpretation:**
- See quick reference table above
- Detailed interpretations: [references/severity-levels.md](references/severity-levels.md)

**⚠️ Check Item 9 immediately** - if positive, see safety protocol

### 4. Clinical Decision-Making

**Follow clinical decision trees:** [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

**General pathways:**
- **PHQ-9 0-4:** Monitor, psychoeducation
- **PHQ-9 5-9:** Behavioral interventions, watchful waiting
- **PHQ-9 10-14:** Active treatment (therapy or medication)
- **PHQ-9 15-19:** Combination therapy, specialty referral
- **PHQ-9 20-27:** Immediate specialty care, higher level of care

**Any Item 9 > 0:** Follow safety protocol regardless of total score

### 5. Document

**Use documentation templates in:**
- [assets/phq-2.md](assets/phq-2.md#documentation-template)
- [assets/phq-9.md](assets/phq-9.md#documentation-template)

**Documentation standards:** [../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md](../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md)

## Treatment Monitoring

**Use PHQ-9 to track progress:**
- **Baseline:** Administer at treatment start
- **Follow-up:** Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- **Response indicators:**
  - <5-point decrease: Minimal response (consider treatment change)
  - 5-9 point decrease: Partial response (continue, monitor)
  - ≥10-point decrease: Clinically significant improvement
  - Score <5: Remission (treatment goal)

**Do NOT use PHQ-2 for treatment monitoring** - insufficient detail

## Special Considerations

### Medical Comorbidity
- Physical illness can elevate somatic symptom scores (items 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Chronic pain, sleep disorders, fatigue inflate scores
- Interpret in context of medical conditions
- Still treat depression even if "explained" by medical illness

### Cultural Factors
- Somatic symptoms may be more prominent in some cultural groups
- Expression of mood symptoms varies across cultures
- Use culturally validated versions when available
- Consider language and health literacy

### Age Considerations
- **Adolescents:** PHQ-9 Modified for Teens (PHQ-A) available
- **Older adults:** PHQ-9 validated, account for medical comorbidity
- **Children <12:** Different screening tools recommended

### Substance Use
- Active substance use can inflate or confound depression scores
- May need to assess after detox for accurate baseline
- Co-occurring disorders require integrated treatment

## Referral Guidelines

### When to Refer to Specialty Mental Health

**Immediate/Urgent:**
- PHQ-9 ≥15 at initial presentation
- Any suicidal ideation (Item 9 > 0)
- Inadequate response to initial treatment
- Patient request for specialty care

**Routine:**
- PHQ-9 10-14 if patient prefers specialist
- Complex presentation (trauma, substance use, medical comorbidity)
- Need for specialized therapy

**Complete referral guidance:** [../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md](../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md)

## Limitations

**PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are screening tools, not diagnostic instruments:**
- Do not replace comprehensive clinical assessment
- Require interpretation within clinical context
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores
- Cannot diagnose based on score alone

**Potential issues:**
- False positives (especially with medical illness affecting somatic items)
- False negatives (patient minimization, literacy issues)
- Cultural/linguistic factors affect responses
- Requires patient insight and honest reporting

## Usage Examples

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen a patient for depression symptoms
- Assess depression severity for treatment planning
- Track treatment response over time
- Determine appropriate level of care
- Support clinical decision-making with validated data

**Example requests:**
- "Help me administer a PHQ-9"
- "I need to screen this patient for depression"
- "Score this PHQ-9 and interpret results"
- "What treatment is recommended for PHQ-9 score of 16?"
- "Patient scored 2 on Item 9 - what do I do?"
