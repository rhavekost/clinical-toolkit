# Depression Screening Comparison

Guide for choosing between PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 screening tools.

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Need for depression screening identified
    ↓
Time-limited setting (primary care, ER, brief encounter)?
    ↓ YES → Start with PHQ-2
    ↓ NO → Use PHQ-9 for comprehensive assessment
    ↓
PHQ-2 score ≥3?
    ↓ YES → Administer full PHQ-9
    ↓ NO → Negative screen, monitor and reassess as needed
```

## When to Use PHQ-2

**Ideal Settings:**
- Primary care routine screening
- Emergency department visits
- Urgent care
- Annual wellness visits
- Large-scale screening programs
- Time-limited encounters

**Advantages:**
- Very brief (< 1 minute)
- High sensitivity for depression
- Easy to administer
- Minimal patient burden
- Good for initial screening in busy settings

**Limitations:**
- Only a screener, not diagnostic
- Positive screen requires full PHQ-9
- Does not assess severity
- Does not include suicidal ideation screening
- Less useful for monitoring treatment response

**Interpretation:**
- Score 0-2: Negative screen (depression unlikely)
- Score ≥3: Positive screen (administer PHQ-9)

## When to Use PHQ-9

**Ideal Settings:**
- Mental health specialty settings
- Diagnostic assessments
- Treatment monitoring
- When time permits comprehensive screening
- Follow-up after positive PHQ-2

**Advantages:**
- Comprehensive depression assessment
- Severity rating (minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe)
- Aligns with DSM-5 criteria
- Includes suicidal ideation screening (Item 9)
- Validated for treatment monitoring
- Can track change over time

**Limitations:**
- Takes 2-3 minutes (longer than PHQ-2)
- May be too long for very brief encounters
- Requires Item 9 safety follow-up if positive

**Interpretation:**
- Score 0-4: Minimal depression
- Score 5-9: Mild depression
- Score 10-14: Moderate depression
- Score 15-19: Moderately severe depression
- Score 20-27: Severe depression

## Two-Stage Screening Approach

### Stage 1: PHQ-2 (Universal Screening)

Administer PHQ-2 to all patients during routine visits.

**If score 0-2:**
- Negative screen
- No further depression screening needed at this time
- Reassess at next visit or if symptoms emerge

**If score ≥3:**
- Positive screen
- Proceed to Stage 2

### Stage 2: PHQ-9 (Comprehensive Assessment)

Administer full PHQ-9 when PHQ-2 is positive.

**Benefits of two-stage approach:**
- Efficient use of time (most patients complete only PHQ-2)
- High sensitivity maintained
- Reduces screening burden
- Focuses detailed assessment on those who need it

## When to Skip PHQ-2 and Go Straight to PHQ-9

**Use PHQ-9 directly when:**
- Patient presents specifically for mental health evaluation
- Depression already suspected based on presentation
- Monitoring established depression diagnosis
- Time is not a significant constraint
- Comprehensive assessment needed for treatment planning
- Need baseline severity for treatment monitoring

**Example scenarios for direct PHQ-9:**
- "I think I'm depressed" (chief complaint)
- Follow-up for known depression
- Mental health intake assessment
- Medication management visit
- Therapy session with depression focus

## Monitoring Treatment Response

### Use PHQ-9 for Treatment Monitoring

**Initial Assessment:**
- Administer PHQ-9 to establish baseline severity

**Follow-up:**
- Readminister PHQ-9 at regular intervals (every 2-4 weeks typically)
- Track score changes over time
- 5-point decrease = treatment response
- 10-point decrease = clinically significant improvement

**Do NOT use PHQ-2 for treatment monitoring:**
- PHQ-2 does not assess severity
- Cannot track meaningful change
- Insufficient detail for treatment decisions

## Frequency of Screening

### General Population (No Depression History)

**PHQ-2:**
- Annual screening during wellness visits
- Or per organizational protocol

**PHQ-9:**
- Only if PHQ-2 positive
- Or if symptoms emerge between screenings

### Patients with Depression History

**During Active Treatment:**
- PHQ-9 every 2-4 weeks
- Monitor treatment response
- Adjust treatment based on scores

**After Remission:**
- PHQ-9 every 3-6 months for first year
- Then annually or per clinical judgment
- Watch for relapse

### High-Risk Populations

**More frequent screening for:**
- Chronic medical illness
- History of depression
- Recent major life stressor
- Postpartum period
- Substance use disorders

**Frequency:**
- PHQ-2 at every visit, or
- PHQ-9 every 1-3 months

## Special Populations

### Primary Care Settings

**Recommendation:**
- Universal PHQ-2 screening at annual visits
- PHQ-9 for positive PHQ-2 screens
- PHQ-9 for anyone presenting with depressive symptoms

### Emergency Department

**Recommendation:**
- PHQ-2 for rapid screening
- PHQ-9 if time permits and PHQ-2 positive
- Always assess suicidal ideation directly if depression suspected

### Mental Health Settings

**Recommendation:**
- PHQ-9 at intake for all patients
- Repeat PHQ-9 every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- PHQ-2 generally not needed (sufficient time for full assessment)

### Postpartum

**Recommendation:**
- Consider Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as first-line
- PHQ-9 is acceptable alternative
- Screen at postpartum visits (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months)

### Adolescents

**Recommendation:**
- PHQ-9 Modified for Teens (PHQ-A) available
- Similar scoring and interpretation
- Annual screening recommended (ages 12+)

### Older Adults

**Recommendation:**
- PHQ-9 validated in older adults
- May need to account for medical comorbidity affecting somatic items
- Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is alternative

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use just the first 2 items of the PHQ-9 as a PHQ-2?**
A: Yes, the PHQ-2 consists of the first two items of the PHQ-9.

**Q: If I'm already giving the PHQ-9, do I need to score the PHQ-2 separately?**
A: No, not necessary. The full PHQ-9 includes all the information from the PHQ-2 and more.

**Q: Can I diagnose depression based on PHQ scores alone?**
A: No. PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are screening tools. Diagnosis requires clinical interview and judgment.

**Q: What if PHQ-2 is negative but I still suspect depression?**
A: Trust your clinical judgment. Administer PHQ-9 if clinical concern remains despite negative PHQ-2.

**Q: How do I handle positive Item 9 on PHQ-9?**
A: Any positive response on Item 9 requires immediate safety assessment. See [item-9-safety-protocol.md](item-9-safety-protocol.md) and [docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Psychometric Properties

### PHQ-9 Validation Data

**Diagnostic Accuracy:**
- **Sensitivity:** 88% for major depression (at cutoff of 10)
- **Specificity:** 88% for major depression (at cutoff of 10)
- Excellent balance of sensitivity and specificity

**Reliability:**
- **Internal consistency:** Cronbach's α = 0.89 (excellent)
- Test-retest reliability well-established

**Treatment Monitoring:**
- **Minimal clinically important difference:** 5-point change
- **Clinically significant improvement:** 10-point change
- Sensitive to treatment effects across multiple studies

**Suicidal Ideation Screening:**
- Item 9 is a validated screener for suicidal thoughts
- ANY positive response on Item 9 requires immediate clinical follow-up

### PHQ-2 Validation Data

**Diagnostic Accuracy:**
- Optimized for sensitivity to minimize missed cases
- Positive screen (≥3) requires full PHQ-9 for specificity

**Efficiency:**
- Reduces screening burden when combined with PHQ-9
- Two-stage approach maintains high sensitivity with better efficiency
