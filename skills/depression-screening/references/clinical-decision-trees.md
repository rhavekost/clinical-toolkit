# Clinical Decision Trees for Depression

Treatment recommendations and clinical pathways based on PHQ-9 severity levels.

## Overview

This guide provides evidence-based treatment recommendations based on PHQ-9 scores and clinical presentation. Always use clinical judgment and individualize treatment.

## Primary Decision Tree

```
PHQ-9 Administered
    ↓
Item 9 > 0?
    ↓ YES → IMMEDIATE SAFETY ASSESSMENT (see item-9-safety-protocol.md)
    ↓ NO
    ↓
What is total score?
    ↓
0-4 (Minimal) → Monitor, psychoeducation, reassess
5-9 (Mild) → Watchful waiting, behavioral interventions, reassess 2-4 weeks
10-14 (Moderate) → Active treatment (therapy or medication), monitor every 2-4 weeks
15-19 (Moderately Severe) → Active treatment (combination often recommended), close monitoring
20-27 (Severe) → Intensive treatment, specialty referral, consider higher level of care
```

## Minimal Depression (PHQ-9: 0-4)

### Clinical Assessment
- No significant depressive symptoms
- Normal functioning
- No treatment indicated for depression

### Recommended Actions

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess during routine care
- Annual PHQ-9 screening

**Psychoeducation:**
- Discuss depression symptoms to watch for
- Provide resources in case symptoms develop
- Encourage healthy lifestyle (sleep, exercise, social connection)

**When to Reassess Sooner:**
- Patient reports subjective distress despite low score
- Life stressors develop
- Symptoms emerge between routine visits

**Follow-up:**
- Next routine appointment or annually
- Patient instructed to contact if symptoms develop

## Mild Depression (PHQ-9: 5-9)

### Clinical Assessment
- Mild symptoms with minimal functional impairment
- May be subsyndromal depression
- Consider watchful waiting before active treatment

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line: Behavioral Interventions**

1. **Behavioral Activation:**
   - Activity scheduling
   - Pleasant event scheduling
   - Exercise (30+ min, 3-5x/week)
   - Sleep hygiene

2. **Psychoeducation:**
   - Nature of depression
   - Self-care strategies
   - When to seek help

3. **Support:**
   - Problem-solving for specific stressors
   - Social support activation

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess PHQ-9 in 2-4 weeks
- Watch for worsening or improvement

**Decision Point at 2-4 Weeks:**

```
PHQ-9 improved to 0-4?
    ↓ YES → Continue current approach, monitor
    ↓ NO
    ↓
PHQ-9 stable (5-9)?
    ↓ Continue behavioral interventions 4-8 more weeks, or
    ↓ Consider initiating active treatment if:
      - Patient preference
      - Functional impairment
      - Symptoms distressing
    ↓
PHQ-9 worsened (≥10)?
    ↓ YES → Move to Moderate Depression pathway
```

**When to Consider Active Treatment Earlier:**
- Patient preference for therapy or medication
- Significant functional impairment despite "mild" score
- Previous history of depression (higher risk of progression)
- Persistent for >2 months

**Treatment Options if Active Treatment Indicated:**
- Psychotherapy (CBT, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy)
- OR medication (SSRI/SNRI)
- Consider patient preference

**Follow-up:**
- PHQ-9 every 2-4 weeks during watchful waiting
- Every 2-4 weeks if treatment initiated

## Moderate Depression (PHQ-9: 10-14)

### Clinical Assessment
- Meets threshold for major depressive disorder (88% sensitivity/specificity at cutoff ≥10)
- Noticeable functional impairment
- Active treatment recommended

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line Treatment Options:**

Choose based on patient preference, availability, previous response:

1. **Psychotherapy alone:**
   - Evidence-based therapy (CBT, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy)
   - Weekly sessions initially
   - 8-12 week trial

2. **Medication alone:**
   - SSRI or SNRI first-line
   - Start low, titrate as needed
   - 4-8 week trial at therapeutic dose

3. **Combination therapy:**
   - Both medication and psychotherapy
   - May offer advantages for some patients
   - Consider if:
     - Previous partial response to monotherapy
     - Patient preference
     - Severe functional impairment

**Monitoring:**
- PHQ-9 every 2-4 weeks
- Safety check each contact (Item 9)
- Assess side effects if on medication
- Treatment response expected by 4-8 weeks

**Decision Point at 4-8 Weeks:**

```
PHQ-9 decreased by ≥5 points?
    ↓ YES (Treatment Response)
    ↓ → Continue current treatment
    ↓ → Monitor for continued improvement
    ↓ → Target: PHQ-9 < 5 (remission)
    ↓
PHQ-9 decreased by < 5 points OR worsened?
    ↓ (Inadequate Response)
    ↓ → Reassess diagnosis and contributing factors
    ↓ → Check treatment adherence
    ↓ → Consider:
        - Increase treatment intensity (more frequent therapy, higher med dose)
        - Switch treatment (different therapy approach or medication)
        - Add treatment (combination if on monotherapy)
        - Refer for specialty evaluation
```

**Safety Monitoring:**
- Assess Item 9 at each contact
- Provide crisis resources
- Safety plan if any suicidal ideation

**Referral Indications:**
- Inadequate response to initial treatment
- Patient request for specialty care
- Complicating factors (trauma, psychosis, substance use)

**Follow-up:**
- Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- Monthly once stable
- Continue PHQ-9 monitoring

## Moderately Severe Depression (PHQ-9: 15-19)

### Clinical Assessment
- Significant symptom burden
- Marked functional impairment
- Higher risk for complications
- Active treatment strongly recommended

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line: Combination Therapy Often Recommended**

1. **Medication:**
   - SSRI or SNRI
   - Consider psychiatry referral for medication management
   - Higher severity often benefits from specialist management

2. **Psychotherapy:**
   - Evidence-based therapy (CBT, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy)
   - Weekly sessions
   - Strong evidence for combination at this severity

**Monitoring:**
- **Close monitoring required**
- PHQ-9 every 1-2 weeks initially
- Safety assessment at every contact
- Consider more frequent contact (phone check-ins between sessions)

**Safety:**
- Detailed safety assessment
- Safety plan
- Crisis resources
- Low threshold for increasing level of care

**Decision Point at 4-8 Weeks:**

```
PHQ-9 decreased to <10?
    ↓ YES → Good response, continue current treatment
    ↓
PHQ-9 decreased by 5-9 points but still ≥10?
    ↓ Partial response
    ↓ → Continue current treatment, monitor closely
    ↓ → Consider augmentation
    ↓
PHQ-9 < 5-point decrease OR worsened?
    ↓ Inadequate response
    ↓ → Specialty mental health referral if not already engaged
    ↓ → Consider higher level of care (IOP, PHP)
    ↓ → Reassess diagnosis
    ↓ → Rule out bipolar disorder, PTSD, substance use
```

**Referral Strongly Recommended:**
- Specialty mental health evaluation
- Psychiatry for medication management
- Consider at initial presentation

**Higher Level of Care Considerations:**

Consider IOP or PHP if:
- Inadequate response to outpatient treatment
- Increasing severity
- Suicidal ideation developing or worsening
- Inability to function in major life roles
- Need for intensive structure

**Follow-up:**
- Weekly or biweekly during acute phase
- Every 2-4 weeks once improving
- Frequent PHQ-9 monitoring

## Severe Depression (PHQ-9: 20-27)

### Clinical Assessment
- Severe symptom burden
- Marked impairment in all domains
- High risk for complications
- May include psychotic features
- Immediate treatment required

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate Steps:**

1. **Safety assessment:**
   - Thorough suicide risk assessment
   - Homicidal ideation assessment
   - Ability to care for basic needs
   - See [item-9-safety-protocol.md](item-9-safety-protocol.md) and [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

2. **Assess for psychotic features:**
   - Hallucinations
   - Delusions
   - Severe disorganization

3. **Assess need for hospitalization:**
   - Suicidal ideation with plan/intent
   - Psychotic features with danger
   - Unable to care for self
   - No adequate support

**Treatment Approach:**

**If Hospitalization NOT Needed:**

1. **Immediate specialty mental health referral:**
   - Same-day or next-day psychiatry evaluation
   - Urgent outpatient or crisis clinic

2. **Combination therapy:**
   - Medication (SSRI/SNRI, possibly others - psychiatric input essential)
   - Intensive psychotherapy

3. **Consider higher level of care:**
   - Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)
   - Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)
   - May be alternative to inpatient

4. **Very close monitoring:**
   - At least weekly contact
   - PHQ-9 weekly
   - Safety assessment at every contact
   - May need daily check-ins

**If Hospitalization Needed:**

Indications for inpatient care:
- Active suicidal ideation with plan and intent
- Psychotic features with danger to self/others
- Severe functional impairment (cannot care for basic needs)
- No adequate outpatient support
- Failed intensive outpatient treatment

**Coordination:**

- Don't release care until specialty treatment engaged
- Bridge care until specialty appointment
- Clear follow-up plan
- Emergency contact provided
- Family/support involvement (with consent)

**Decision Point at 1-2 Weeks:**

```
PHQ-9 improved?
    ↓ YES → Continue intensive treatment, monitor closely
    ↓ NO or WORSENED
    ↓ → Consider hospitalization
    ↓ → Reassess safety
    ↓ → Medication adjustment (psychiatric consultation)
    ↓ → Increase level of care
```

**Follow-up:**
- At least weekly
- Psychiatric follow-up as scheduled (often weekly initially)
- Safety checks between appointments if needed
- Continue until significant improvement

## Special Considerations

### Positive Item 9 (Suicidal Ideation)

**Regardless of total PHQ-9 score:**
- Immediate safety assessment required
- See [item-9-safety-protocol.md](item-9-safety-protocol.md)
- May need higher level of care regardless of total score
- Safety is first priority, then depression severity

### Treatment-Resistant Depression

**If inadequate response after:**
- 2+ adequate trials of antidepressants (8+ weeks each at therapeutic dose)
- Adequate trial of evidence-based psychotherapy

**Consider:**
- Specialty psychiatry evaluation
- Rule out contributing factors (hypothyroidism, vitamin D, sleep apnea, etc.)
- Medication augmentation or switch
- Different therapy modality
- ECT evaluation in severe cases
- TMS evaluation
- Esketamine evaluation

### Medical Comorbidity

**Physical illness affecting depression:**
- Chronic pain
- Hypothyroidism
- Vitamin deficiencies
- Sleep disorders
- Neurological conditions

**Approach:**
- Treat medical conditions concurrently
- Coordinate with medical providers
- Adjust interpretation if somatic symptoms inflated by medical condition
- Still treat depression even if "explained" by medical illness

### Substance Use Comorbidity

**Depression + substance use:**
- Common comorbidity
- Each worsens the other
- Integrated treatment ideal

**Approach:**
- Assess and address both
- Consider whether depression is primary or substance-induced
- May need substance use treatment first or concurrently
- Close monitoring

### Cultural Considerations

**Cultural factors in treatment:**
- Somatic symptoms may predominate in some cultures
- Stigma may affect help-seeking and treatment adherence
- Family involvement varies by culture
- Culturally adapted treatments when available
- Interpreter services if needed

## Treatment Monitoring

### Regular PHQ-9 Monitoring

**Frequency:**
- Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment (more frequent for higher severity)
- Monthly once stable
- Any time clinical concern

**Use scores to guide treatment:**
- Track improvement
- Identify plateaus
- Recognize worsening

### Treatment Response Definitions

**Minimal response:** < 5-point decrease
- Consider treatment change

**Partial response:** 5-9 point decrease
- Continue treatment, monitor
- May need augmentation

**Good response:** ≥10-point decrease
- Clinically significant
- Continue treatment

**Remission:** PHQ-9 < 5
- Goal of treatment
- Plan for maintenance and relapse prevention

## Relapse Prevention

### After Remission

**Continue treatment:**
- Medication: 6-12 months minimum after first episode, longer for recurrent depression
- Therapy: Taper frequency, maintenance phase

**Monitor:**
- PHQ-9 every 3-6 months
- Watch for early warning signs

**Relapse prevention planning:**
- Identify triggers
- Early warning signs
- Action plan if symptoms return
