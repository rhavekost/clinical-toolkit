# Eating Risk Checklist (Non‑Validated)

## Description

This is an **original, non‑validated** checklist for eating disorder risk factors and medical red flags. It is **not** a validated screener and does not diagnose.

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.

1. Confirm this is a non-validated checklist and check readiness.
2. Ask one item at a time from the checklist and wait for a response.
3. Summarize key risks and confirm accuracy before moving on.
4. At the end, synthesize red flags and recommended next steps.
5. If immediate medical or safety concerns arise, pause and follow appropriate protocols.
