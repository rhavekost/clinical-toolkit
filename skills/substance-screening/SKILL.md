# Substance Use Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated substance use screening instruments. The AUDIT-C assesses alcohol use patterns, while the DAST-10 screens for drug use problems.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify problematic substance use, assess severity, and support clinical decision-making about further evaluation or intervention. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive substance use assessment.

## Available Assessments

| Assessment | Items | Purpose | Cutoffs | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| **AUDIT-C** | 3 | Alcohol use screening | Gender-specific cutoffs | Brief version of full AUDIT |
| **DAST-10** | 10 | Drug use screening | 1-2 low, 3-5 moderate, 6-8 substantial, 9-10 severe | Covers past 12 months |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for alcohol use problems
- Screen for drug use problems
- Assess substance use severity
- Identify need for further assessment
- Track changes in substance use

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for alcohol use"
- "I need to administer a DAST-10"
- "Can you score this AUDIT-C?"
- "Interpret these substance use screening results"

## Administration & Scoring

### AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption)

**Key Facts:**
- 3 items assessing alcohol consumption patterns
- First 3 questions from the full 10-item AUDIT
- Gender-specific cutoffs improve accuracy
- Cutoff ≥4 for men, ≥3 for women indicates hazardous drinking
- Positive screen warrants further assessment

*[Full instrument items, scoring algorithm, and interpretation to be added]*

### DAST-10 (Drug Abuse Screening Test - 10 item)

**Key Facts:**
- 10 yes/no questions about drug use consequences
- Covers past 12 months
- Excludes alcohol and tobacco
- Score ranges: 1-2 (low), 3-5 (moderate), 6-8 (substantial), 9-10 (severe)
- Brief version of 28-item DAST

*[Full instrument items, scoring algorithm, and interpretation to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Detailed interpretation guidelines for score ranges, clinical significance, and next steps to be added]*

**AUDIT-C Interpretation:**
- Positive screen indicates hazardous drinking
- Higher scores suggest greater risk
- Follow up with brief intervention or full AUDIT
- Consider referral for specialized assessment

**DAST-10 Score Ranges:**
- 0: No problems reported
- 1-2: Low level of problems
- 3-5: Moderate level of problems
- 6-8: Substantial level of problems
- 9-10: Severe level of problems

## Safety Protocols

**Substance use screening requires:**
- Non-judgmental, confidential approach
- Clear explanation of purpose
- Assess for immediate safety concerns (intoxication, withdrawal)
- Evaluate need for medical management of withdrawal
- Screen for co-occurring mental health conditions
- Assess readiness to change

**Safety Considerations:**
- Acute intoxication or withdrawal may require immediate medical attention
- Assess for suicidal ideation, especially with depressants
- Consider safety in pregnancy
- Evaluate for polysubstance use
- Screen for risk behaviors (driving, unsafe sex)

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not diagnose substance use disorders
- Requires interpretation within clinical context
- Self-report may underestimate use
- Cultural factors affect disclosure
- Does not assess for all substances
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Assessment Considerations:**
- Create safe, non-judgmental environment
- Assure confidentiality (note legal limitations)
- Use non-stigmatizing language
- Consider motivational interviewing approach
- Assess across multiple substances
- Evaluate impact on functioning

**Special Populations:**
- Pregnancy: Different risk thresholds
- Adolescents: Consider developmental factors
- Older adults: May have different patterns
- Co-occurring disorders: Common and require integrated care
- Cultural factors in substance use and help-seeking

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
