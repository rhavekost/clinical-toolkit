# Substance Use Screening

## Description

This skill helps administer and interpret validated substance use screening instruments. The AUDIT-C assesses alcohol use patterns, while the DAST-10 screens for drug use problems.

**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify problematic substance use, assess severity, and support clinical decision-making about further evaluation or intervention. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive substance use assessment.

**IMPORTANT: Screen for BOTH alcohol (AUDIT-C) and drugs (DAST-10).** They often co-occur and require different assessment and treatment approaches.

## Quick Reference: Assessment Selection

| Assessment | Items | Time | Substance | Cutoff | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **AUDIT-C** | 3 | < 1 min | Alcohol only | Men ≥4, Women ≥3 | Universal screening, primary care |
| **DAST-10** | 10 | 2-3 min | Drugs (not alcohol) | ≥3 | Universal screening, any clinical setting |
| **Full AUDIT** | 10 | 3-5 min | Alcohol only | ≥8 | After positive AUDIT-C, comprehensive assessment |

**Recommended approach:** Use AUDIT-C + DAST-10 together for complete substance use screening. See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md) for detailed guidance.

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Screen for alcohol use problems
- Screen for drug use problems
- Assess substance use severity
- Identify need for further assessment or intervention
- Track changes in substance use patterns

**Example requests:**
- "Help me screen for alcohol use"
- "I need to administer a DAST-10"
- "Can you score this AUDIT-C?"
- "Interpret these substance use screening results"

## Quick Reference: Severity Levels

### AUDIT-C Interpretation (Alcohol)

**Men:**
- **0-3:** Low risk - Annual rescreening
- **4-5:** Hazardous drinking - Brief intervention
- **6-7:** Harmful/high risk - Brief intervention + full AUDIT, consider referral
- **8-12:** Severe risk - Specialty addiction treatment referral required

**Women:**
- **0-2:** Low risk - Annual rescreening
- **3-4:** Hazardous drinking - Brief intervention
- **5-7:** Harmful/high risk - Brief intervention + full AUDIT, consider referral
- **8-12:** Severe risk - Specialty addiction treatment referral required

### DAST-10 Interpretation (Drugs)

- **0-2:** No/minimal risk - Routine monitoring
- **3-5:** Moderate risk - Comprehensive assessment, consider outpatient treatment
- **6-8:** Substantial risk - Specialty addiction treatment referral required
- **9-10:** Severe risk - Immediate specialty referral, higher level of care

## Assessment Administration

### AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Concise)

**Complete assessment details:** [assets/audit-c.md](assets/audit-c.md)

**Quick Facts:**
- 3 items assessing alcohol consumption patterns
- First 3 questions from the full 10-item AUDIT
- Gender-specific cutoffs (women metabolize alcohol differently)
- Positive screen warrants brief intervention or full AUDIT

**Items:**
1. Frequency of drinking (0-4 points)
2. Typical number of drinks per day (0-4 points)
3. Frequency of binge drinking (≥6 drinks on one occasion) (0-4 points)

**Scoring:**
- Total score range: 0-12
- Men: ≥4 positive screen
- Women: ≥3 positive screen

**Standard Drink Definition:**
- 12 oz beer (5% alcohol) = 1 drink
- 5 oz wine (12% alcohol) = 1 drink
- 1.5 oz spirits/liquor (40% alcohol) = 1 drink

**Next Steps:**
- Score below cutoff: Positive feedback, rescreen annually
- Score 4-7 (men) or 3-7 (women): Brief intervention, follow-up 1-3 months
- Score ≥8: Full AUDIT assessment + specialty referral

### DAST-10 (Drug Abuse Screening Test - 10 Item)

**Complete assessment details:** [assets/dast-10.md](assets/dast-10.md)

**Quick Facts:**
- 10 binary (Yes/No) questions about drug use consequences
- Covers past 12 months
- Excludes alcohol and tobacco
- Assesses consequences and dependence, not just use
- Item 3 is reverse scored (Yes = 0, No = 1)

**Key Items Cover:**
- Drug use beyond medical reasons
- Polysubstance use
- Loss of control
- Blackouts/flashbacks
- Guilt about use
- Family complaints and neglect
- Illegal activities to obtain drugs
- Withdrawal symptoms
- Medical complications

**Scoring:**
- Total score range: 0-10
- Score 1 point for each "Yes" (except Item 3: score "No")
- ≥3 indicates problematic drug use requiring further assessment

**Next Steps:**
- Score 0-2: Routine monitoring
- Score ≥3: **Detailed substance use history required** (specific substances, frequency, route)
- **If opioid use identified:** Immediate medication-assisted treatment (MAT) discussion
- **If injection drug use:** Infectious disease screening (HIV, Hepatitis C)

## Clinical Decision-Making

For structured clinical decision trees covering screening pathways, treatment selection, withdrawal management, and co-occurring disorders, see [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

**Quick Treatment Recommendations:**

**AUDIT-C:**
- Men 4-5, Women 3-4: Brief intervention (5-15 minutes)
- Men 6-7, Women 5-7: Brief intervention + full AUDIT + consider referral
- ≥8 (either gender): Specialty addiction treatment + assess withdrawal risk

**DAST-10:**
- 3-5: Motivational interviewing, assess for substance use disorder, consider outpatient treatment
- 6-8: Specialty addiction treatment referral, determine specific substances, MAT if opioids
- 9-10: Immediate specialty referral, consider higher level of care (IOP, residential)

**Substance-Specific Considerations:**

**Opioid Use Disorder:**
- Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) recommended immediately
- Options: Buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone
- Do not require abstinence before MAT
- Naloxone (Narcan) prescription for all patients (overdose prevention)

**Stimulant Use (cocaine, methamphetamine):**
- Behavioral therapies (no FDA-approved medications)
- Cardiac and psychiatric evaluation
- Contingency management, cognitive-behavioral therapy

**Benzodiazepines:**
- **Never abrupt discontinuation** (seizure risk)
- Medically supervised taper required
- High overdose risk when combined with opioids

## Brief Intervention for Positive AUDIT-C (4-7 range)

**Components (5-15 minutes):**
1. **Provide Feedback:** Compare drinking to low-risk guidelines, discuss health risks
2. **Assess Readiness:** "How do you feel about your drinking?"
3. **Set Goals:** Reduce to low-risk limits or abstinence
4. **Provide Resources:** Written materials, drinking diary, treatment resources
5. **Follow-Up:** Reassess AUDIT-C in 1-3 months

**Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines:**
- Men: ≤14 drinks/week, ≤4 drinks/day
- Women: ≤7 drinks/week, ≤3 drinks/day

## Safety Protocols

**Assessment Approach:**
- Non-judgmental, confidential environment
- Normalize screening: "I ask all my patients these questions"
- Use non-stigmatizing language
- Assure confidentiality (explain mandatory reporting limits)
- Create safe space for disclosure

**Immediate Safety Concerns:**
- **Acute intoxication or withdrawal** → Medical evaluation
- **Alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal risk** → Assess for medically supervised detoxification (seizure risk)
- **Opioid use disorder** → MAT discussion + naloxone prescription
- **Injection drug use** → Infectious disease screening + harm reduction education
- **Suicidal ideation** → Crisis intervention per [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

**Withdrawal Risk Assessment:**
- **High risk (medical supervision required):** Alcohol, benzodiazepines (can be life-threatening)
- **Moderate risk:** Opioids (severe discomfort but not typically life-threatening)
- **DAST-10 Item 9 (withdrawal symptoms) positive = physiological dependence**

## Limitations & Considerations

**This is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument:**
- Does not diagnose substance use disorders
- Self-report may underestimate use (especially illegal drugs)
- Requires interpretation within clinical context
- Cultural factors affect disclosure and reporting
- Clinical judgment always supersedes screening scores

**Assessment Best Practices:**
- Create safe, non-judgmental environment
- Use motivational interviewing approach
- Avoid stigmatizing language ("alcoholic," "junkie," "clean," "dirty")
- Preferred: "person with substance use disorder," "person in recovery"
- Frame as health issue, not moral failing

**Special Populations:**
- **Pregnancy:** Any substance use = high risk, immediate referral to perinatal services
- **Adolescents:** Consider CRAFFT screening tool instead
- **Older adults:** May use lower cutoffs, assess alcohol-medication interactions
- **Chronic pain patients:** Carefully assess prescription opioid use vs. opioid use disorder

**Co-Occurring Disorders:**
Very high comorbidity with substance use disorders:
- Depression (30-50%) - Screen with ../../depression-screening/
- Anxiety disorders (20-30%) - Screen with ../../anxiety-screening/
- PTSD (30-50%) - Screen with ../../trauma-screening/
- Suicidal ideation - Screen with ../../suicide-screening/

**Integrated treatment approach needed when co-occurring disorders present**
