# Ultra-Brief Screening

## Description

This skill provides the PHQ-4, a rapid combined depression and anxiety screener ideal for high-volume or time-limited settings.

## Quick Reference

| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Cutoff | When to Use |
|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **PHQ-4** | 4 | <1 min | Ultra-brief depression + anxiety screen | Total ≥6 suggests high likelihood | Primary care, universal screening, triage |

## Assessment Tool

### PHQ-4

**Complete assessment with items, scoring, and documentation:**
→ [assets/phq-4.md](assets/phq-4.md)

## Interactive Administration (Optional)

Use this mode when the clinician says "start" or "administer" the PHQ-4.

1. Confirm readiness and explain the past 2 weeks time frame plus the 0-3 response scale.
2. Ask one item at a time (verbatim from the asset file) and wait for a response before continuing.
3. Accept numeric or verbal responses; if unclear or out of range, ask for clarification.
4. Record each response, compute the total score (0-12), and track depression/anxiety sub-scores.
5. If the screen is positive, recommend PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7 for severity assessment.
6. Offer a brief documentation summary if requested.

## Clinical Workflow

1. **Administer PHQ-4**
2. **Score and interpret**
3. **If positive**, proceed to PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7 for severity
4. **Document** results and next steps

## Documentation

Use the documentation template in the PHQ-4 asset file.
