# Treatment Planning

## Description

This skill provides frameworks and tools for developing evidence-based, collaborative treatment plans. Includes SMART goals methodology, level of care guidance, and measurement-based care approaches.

**Clinical Context:** Effective treatment planning translates assessment findings into actionable, measurable interventions. These frameworks support collaborative goal-setting and progress monitoring while maintaining clinical flexibility.

## Available Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose | Key Components |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **SMART Goals** | Behavioral health goal setting | Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound |
| **Level of Care Guidance** | Matching symptoms to treatment intensity | Criteria for outpatient, IOP, PHP, residential, inpatient |
| **Measurement-Based Care** | Using assessments to track progress | Baseline, regular monitoring, treatment adjustment |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Develop treatment goals with patients
- Determine appropriate level of care
- Create measurement-based care plans
- Write treatment plan documentation
- Monitor and adjust treatment based on outcomes

**Example requests:**
- "Help me write SMART goals for this patient"
- "What level of care does this patient need?"
- "How do I implement measurement-based care?"
- "Guide me through treatment planning"

## Framework Details

### SMART Goals Framework

**Purpose:** Structure goals to be clear, achievable, and measurable for behavioral health treatment.

**SMART Criteria:**
- **S - Specific:** Clear, concrete behaviors or outcomes
- **M - Measurable:** Quantifiable progress indicators
- **A - Achievable:** Realistic given patient's current functioning and resources
- **R - Relevant:** Aligned with patient's values and treatment needs
- **T - Time-bound:** Specific timeframe for achievement

**Examples:**
*[Well-formed and poorly-formed goal examples to be added]*

**Common Goal Areas:**
- Symptom reduction
- Functional improvement
- Coping skills development
- Relationship enhancement
- Recovery maintenance

*[Detailed goal-writing guide with examples across diagnostic categories to be added]*

### Level of Care Guidance

**Purpose:** Match symptom severity and functional impairment to appropriate treatment intensity.

**Level of Care Continuum:**

1. **Outpatient (OP):**
   - 1-2 sessions per week
   - Stable, lower acuity symptoms
   - Adequate social support
   - No acute safety concerns

2. **Intensive Outpatient (IOP):**
   - 9+ hours per week, multiple days
   - Moderate symptoms affecting functioning
   - Needs structure but can maintain community living
   - Some safety concerns manageable with increased support

3. **Partial Hospitalization (PHP):**
   - 20+ hours per week, weekdays
   - Significant symptom severity
   - Marked functional impairment
   - Needs daily clinical monitoring
   - Alternative to inpatient or step-down

4. **Residential Treatment:**
   - 24-hour structured environment
   - Severe, persistent symptoms
   - Unable to maintain community living safely
   - Needs constant supervision, not acute medical

5. **Inpatient Psychiatric:**
   - 24-hour medical management
   - Acute safety risk (suicide, homicide, grave disability)
   - Severe symptoms requiring medical monitoring
   - Brief stabilization focused

**Decision Factors:**
- Symptom severity and acuity
- Suicide/violence risk
- Functional impairment
- Social support availability
- Previous treatment response
- Co-occurring conditions
- Patient preference (when safe)

*[Detailed level of care criteria and decision trees to be added]*

### Measurement-Based Care

**Purpose:** Systematically use assessment data to guide treatment decisions and track outcomes.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Baseline Assessment:** Establish starting point with validated measures
2. **Regular Monitoring:** Consistent re-assessment (weekly, monthly)
3. **Collaborative Review:** Share results with patient
4. **Treatment Adjustment:** Modify interventions based on progress
5. **Outcome Tracking:** Document change over time

**Common Measures:**
- PHQ-9 (depression)
- GAD-7 (anxiety)
- PCL-5 (PTSD)
- Functioning scales
- Quality of life measures

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Select appropriate measures for presenting problems
2. Administer at baseline
3. Set review schedule (e.g., every 4 sessions)
4. Graph progress with patient
5. Discuss results and adjust treatment
6. Document in clinical notes

**Using Measurement to Guide Treatment:**
- Reliable change indices
- Clinically significant change
- When to intensify treatment
- When to step down care
- When to change approaches

*[Detailed measurement-based care implementation guide to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Guidelines for translating assessment into treatment planning to be added]*

**Treatment Plan Development Process:**
1. Review assessment findings
2. Identify primary problems/diagnoses
3. Discuss patient's goals and priorities
4. Determine appropriate level of care
5. Develop SMART goals collaboratively
6. Select evidence-based interventions
7. Establish progress monitoring plan
8. Set review timeline

**Matching Interventions to Goals:**
- Evidence-based practices for specific diagnoses
- Patient preferences and values
- Cultural considerations
- Available resources
- Therapist competencies

## Safety Protocols

**Treatment planning must address safety:**
- Document suicide/violence risk assessment
- Include crisis plan in treatment plan
- Identify early warning signs
- Specify emergency contacts and procedures
- Plan for means restriction if indicated
- Schedule more frequent contact if needed

**When to revise treatment plan:**
- Emergence of safety concerns
- Significant symptom worsening
- Major life changes or stressors
- Lack of progress over reasonable timeframe
- Patient request or preference change

*[Detailed safety protocols to be added]*

## Limitations & Considerations

**These are support frameworks, not rigid requirements:**
- Treatment plans are collaborative documents
- Patient autonomy and choice essential
- Cultural factors shape goal priorities
- Social determinants affect achievability
- Flexibility within structure
- Clinical judgment guides application

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Individualism vs. collectivism in goal-setting
- Family involvement expectations
- Traditional healing integration
- Language and communication style
- Structural barriers to care access
- Cultural concepts of distress and recovery

**Common Challenges:**
- Patient and clinician goals may differ
- Insurance limitations on level of care
- Limited availability of appropriate services
- Social determinants limiting goal achievement
- Balancing structure with flexibility

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
