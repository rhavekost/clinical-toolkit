  "instructions": "# Treatment Planning\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides frameworks and tools for developing evidence-based, collaborative treatment plans. Includes SMART goals methodology, level of care guidance, and measurement-based care approaches.\n\n**Clinical Context:** Effective treatment planning translates assessment findings into actionable, measurable interventions. These frameworks support collaborative goal-setting and progress monitoring while maintaining clinical flexibility.\n\n## Available Frameworks\n\n| Framework | Purpose | Key Components |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|\n| **SMART Goals** | Behavioral health goal setting | Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound |\n| **Level of Care Guidance** | Matching symptoms to treatment intensity | Criteria for outpatient, IOP, PHP, residential, inpatient |\n| **Measurement-Based Care** | Using assessments to track progress | Baseline, regular monitoring, treatment adjustment |\n\n## Usage\n\nThis skill can be invoked when you need to:\n- Develop treatment goals with patients\n- Determine appropriate level of care\n- Create measurement-based care plans\n- Write treatment plan documentation\n- Monitor and adjust treatment based on outcomes\n\n**Example requests:**\n- \"Help me write SMART goals for this patient\"\n- \"What level of care does this patient need?\"\n- \"How do I implement measurement-based care?\"\n- \"Guide me through treatment planning\"\n\n## Framework Details\n\n### SMART Goals Framework\n\n**Purpose:** Structure goals to be clear, achievable, and measurable for behavioral health treatment.\n\n**SMART Criteria:**\n- **S - Specific:** Clear, concrete behaviors or outcomes\n- **M - Measurable:** Quantifiable progress indicators\n- **A - Achievable:** Realistic given patient's current functioning and resources\n- **R - Relevant:** Aligned with patient's values and treatment needs\n- **T - Time-bound:** Specific timeframe for achievement\n\n**Examples:**\n*[Well-formed and poorly-formed goal examples to be added]*\n\n**Common Goal Areas:**\n- Symptom reduction\n- Functional improvement\n- Coping skills development\n- Relationship enhancement\n- Recovery maintenance\n\n*[Detailed goal-writing guide with examples across diagnostic categories to be added]*\n\n### Level of Care Guidance\n\n**Purpose:** Match symptom severity and functional impairment to appropriate treatment intensity.\n\n**Level of Care Continuum:**\n\n1. **Outpatient (OP):**\n   - 1-2 sessions per week\n   - Stable, lower acuity symptoms\n   - Adequate social support\n   - No acute safety concerns\n\n2. **Intensive Outpatient (IOP):**\n   - 9+ hours per week, multiple days\n   - Moderate symptoms affecting functioning\n   - Needs structure but can maintain community living\n   - Some safety concerns manageable with increased support\n\n3. **Partial Hospitalization (PHP):**\n   - 20+ hours per week, weekdays\n   - Significant symptom severity\n   - Marked functional impairment\n   - Needs daily clinical monitoring\n   - Alternative to inpatient or step-down\n\n4. **Residential Treatment:**\n   - 24-hour structured environment\n   - Severe, persistent symptoms\n   - Unable to maintain community living safely\n   - Needs constant supervision, not acute medical\n\n5. **Inpatient Psychiatric:**\n   - 24-hour medical management\n   - Acute safety risk (suicide, homicide, grave disability)\n   - Severe symptoms requiring medical monitoring\n   - Brief stabilization focused\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- Symptom severity and acuity\n- Suicide/violence risk\n- Functional impairment\n- Social support availability\n- Previous treatment response\n- Co-occurring conditions\n- Patient preference (when safe)\n\n*[Detailed level of care criteria and decision trees to be added]*\n\n### Measurement-Based Care\n\n**Purpose:** Systematically use assessment data to guide treatment decisions and track outcomes.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1. **Baseline Assessment:** Establish starting point with validated measures\n2. **Regular Monitoring:** Consistent re-assessment (weekly, monthly)\n3. **Collaborative Review:** Share results with patient\n4. **Treatment Adjustment:** Modify interventions based on progress\n5. **Outcome Tracking:** Document change over time\n\n**Common Measures:**\n- PHQ-9 (depression)\n- GAD-7 (anxiety)\n- PCL-5 (PTSD)\n- Functioning scales\n- Quality of life measures\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Select appropriate measures for presenting problems\n2. Administer at baseline\n3. Set review schedule (e.g., every 4 sessions)\n4. Graph progress with patient\n5. Discuss results and adjust treatment\n6. Document in clinical notes\n\n**Using Measurement to Guide Treatment:**\n- Reliable change indices\n- Clinically significant change\n- When to intensify treatment\n- When to step down care\n- When to change approaches\n\n*[Detailed measurement-based care implementation guide to be added]*\n\n## Clinical Interpretation\n\n*[Guidelines for translating assessment into treatment planning to be added]*\n\n**Treatment Plan Development Process:**\n1. Review assessment findings\n2. Identify primary problems/diagnoses\n3. Discuss patient's goals and priorities\n4. Determine appropriate level of care\n5. Develop SMART goals collaboratively\n6. Select evidence-based interventions\n7. Establish progress monitoring plan\n8. Set review timeline\n\n**Matching Interventions to Goals:**\n- Evidence-based practices for specific diagnoses\n- Patient preferences and values\n- Cultural considerations\n- Available resources\n- Therapist competencies\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n**Treatment planning must address safety:**\n- Document suicide/violence risk assessment\n- Include crisis plan in treatment plan\n- Identify early warning signs\n- Specify emergency contacts and procedures\n- Plan for means restriction if indicated\n- Schedule more frequent contact if needed\n\n**When to revise treatment plan:**\n- Emergence of safety concerns\n- Significant symptom worsening\n- Major life changes or stressors\n- Lack of progress over reasonable timeframe\n- Patient request or preference change\n\n*[Detailed safety protocols to be added]*\n\n## Limitations & Considerations\n\n**These are support frameworks, not rigid requirements:**\n- Treatment plans are collaborative documents\n- Patient autonomy and choice essential\n- Cultural factors shape goal priorities\n- Social determinants affect achievability\n- Flexibility within structure\n- Clinical judgment guides application\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n- Individualism vs. collectivism in goal-setting\n- Family involvement expectations\n- Traditional healing integration\n- Language and communication style\n- Structural barriers to care access\n- Cultural concepts of distress and recovery\n\n**Common Challenges:**\n- Patient and clinician goals may differ\n- Insurance limitations on level of care\n- Limited availability of appropriate services\n- Social determinants limiting goal achievement\n- Balancing structure with flexibility\n\n*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*\n\n## References\n\n**SMART Goals:**\n- Doran GT.
