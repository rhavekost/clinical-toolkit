  "instructions": "# Opioid MME Calculator\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides a structured way to calculate total daily MME using CDC conversion factors and safety cautions. It is a support tool and does not replace clinical judgment or patient-specific considerations.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Use | Purpose |\n|-----|---------|\n| MME calculation | Standardize opioid dose comparisons and monitor risk |\n\n## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)\n\nUse this mode when the clinician asks to calculate MME step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm readiness and the target time period (current daily regimen).\n2. Collect one medication at a time: name, route, dose, and frequency.\n3. Clarify PRN vs scheduled dosing and any long-acting vs short-acting formulations.\n4. Calculate per-opioid MME and then total daily MME.\n5. Summarize results and reference safety cautions.\n\n## Calculation Guide\n\nSee: [assets/mme-calculation.md](assets/mme-calculation.md)\n\n## Safety & Limitations\n\nSee: [references/cautions.md](references/cautions.md)\n\n## Documentation\n\n- List each opioid, route, dose, and frequency\n- Calculate each opioid’s daily MME\n- Sum totals and note risk thresholds\n",
