# Canadian C-Spine Rule

## Purpose
Determine the need for cervical spine imaging in alert, stable trauma patients.

## Intended Population
Alert (GCS 15), stable trauma patients age >=16 with potential cervical spine injury.

## Inputs
### High-Risk Factors (any => imaging required)
- Age >=65 years
- Dangerous mechanism (e.g., fall from elevation >3 ft/5 stairs, axial load, high-speed MVC, rollover/ejection, motorized recreational vehicles, bicycle collision)
- Paresthesias in extremities

### Low-Risk Factors (allow safe assessment of ROM)
- Simple rear-end MVC
- Sitting position in ED
- Ambulatory at any time
- Delayed onset of neck pain
- Absence of midline cervical spine tenderness

### Range of Motion
- Ability to actively rotate neck 45 degrees left and right

## Algorithm
1. If any **high-risk factor** is present: imaging required.
2. If no high-risk factors, assess **low-risk factors**.
   - If none present: imaging required.
3. If at least one low-risk factor present, assess ROM.
   - If able to rotate 45 degrees left and right: no imaging required.
   - If unable: imaging required.

## Output
Imaging required: yes/no.

## Interpretation
Use with clinical judgment and local trauma protocols.

## Limitations
- Not validated for unstable patients, penetrating trauma, or GCS <15.
- Requires cooperative patient and reliable exam.

## Example
Patient age 30, rear-end MVC, ambulatory, no midline tenderness, full ROM:
- Imaging not required.
