# Ottawa Ankle Rules

## Purpose
Determine the need for ankle or foot radiographs after acute ankle injury.

## Intended Population
Adults with acute ankle or midfoot injury and pain. Use caution in children, pregnant patients, or injuries >10 days old.

## Inputs
| Finding | Required | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Pain in malleolar zone | Yes | Determines ankle rule eligibility |
| Pain in midfoot zone | Yes | Determines foot rule eligibility |
| Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of lateral malleolus | No | 6 cm posterior edge or tip |
| Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of medial malleolus | No | 6 cm posterior edge or tip |
| Bone tenderness at base of 5th metatarsal | No | - |
| Bone tenderness at navicular | No | - |
| Inability to bear weight (4 steps) immediately and in ED | No | 4 steps both immediately and in ED |

## Algorithm
### Ankle X-ray series
Indicated if **pain in malleolar zone** and any of:
- Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of lateral malleolus
- Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of medial malleolus
- Inability to bear weight (4 steps) both immediately and in ED

### Foot X-ray series
Indicated if **pain in midfoot zone** and any of:
- Bone tenderness at base of 5th metatarsal
- Bone tenderness at navicular
- Inability to bear weight (4 steps) both immediately and in ED

## Output
Radiograph indicated: yes/no (ankle series, foot series, or both).

## Interpretation
If criteria are not met, radiography is generally not indicated. Use clinical judgment for special populations.

## Limitations
- Not validated for pediatric populations or multiple injuries.
- Use caution in intoxicated or unreliable patients.

## Example
Patient with malleolar pain, lateral malleolar tenderness, and can bear weight:
- Ankle X-ray indicated (tenderness criterion met)
