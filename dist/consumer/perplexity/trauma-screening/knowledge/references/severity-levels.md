# PTSD Severity Levels

This reference provides detailed interpretation of PTSD severity across PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5 screening tools.

## PC-PTSD-5 Interpretation

### Negative Screen (0-2)
**Clinical Meaning:** Low probability of PTSD. Fewer than 3 PTSD symptoms endorsed.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Minimal or no current PTSD symptoms
- Trauma exposure may be present but not causing significant distress
- Functioning relatively intact

**Recommended Actions:**
- Routine monitoring during regular care
- Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses
- Reassess if symptoms emerge or worsen
- No PCL-5 needed unless clinical concern arises

### Positive Screen (≥3)
**Clinical Meaning:** Elevated PTSD symptoms warrant comprehensive assessment. Screen positive indicates probable PTSD requiring further evaluation.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Three or more core PTSD symptoms present
- Likely functional impairment
- May meet criteria for PTSD diagnosis

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Required:** Administer full PCL-5 for comprehensive assessment
- Do not diagnose based on PC-PTSD-5 alone (screening tool only)
- Assess safety and current coping strategies
- Consider immediate referral if severe symptoms or safety concerns

**IMPORTANT:** PC-PTSD-5 is a screener, not a diagnostic instrument. Positive screens require follow-up with PCL-5 and clinical interview.

## PCL-5 Severity Levels

### Subclinical/Mild Symptoms (0-30)
**Clinical Meaning:** Below threshold for clinical PTSD. Symptoms present but minimal impact.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Some trauma-related symptoms present
- Minimal functional impairment
- May represent subclinical distress or normal trauma recovery
- Symptoms may not meet DSM-5 cluster requirements

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor symptoms over time
- Provide psychoeducation about trauma recovery
- Teach basic coping strategies and self-care
- Reassess in 4-6 weeks if symptoms persist
- No treatment typically indicated unless patient requests support

### Moderate PTSD Symptoms (31-44)
**Clinical Meaning:** Moderate PTSD severity with noticeable functional impairment. Likely meets DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Clear PTSD symptoms across multiple clusters
- Functional impairment in work, social, or personal domains
- Daily activities affected but manageable
- Patient can still engage in routine tasks with effort

**Recommended Actions:**
- Evidence-based trauma treatment recommended:
  - Trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT)
  - Prolonged Exposure (PE)
  - Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
  - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Consider medication (SSRIs) as adjunct or if therapy unavailable
- Regular monitoring (every 2-4 weeks)
- Safety assessment at each contact
- Assess for comorbid depression, anxiety, substance use

### Severe PTSD Symptoms (45-59)
**Clinical Meaning:** Severe PTSD with significant functional impairment across multiple life domains.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Pervasive PTSD symptoms
- Significant impairment in work, relationships, and self-care
- May struggle to complete daily activities
- High distress levels
- Often comorbid conditions present

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Active treatment strongly recommended**
- Evidence-based trauma-focused therapy (PE, CPT, TF-CBT, EMDR)
- Consider combination treatment (therapy + medication)
- Close monitoring (weekly or biweekly)
- Comprehensive safety assessment
- Screen for suicidal ideation, self-harm, substance use
- Referral for specialty mental health care if not already connected
- Consider higher level of care if:
  - Suicidal ideation present
  - Severe substance use
  - Unable to function in outpatient setting
  - Inadequate response to outpatient treatment

### Extreme PTSD Symptoms (≥60)
**Clinical Meaning:** Extreme PTSD severity with marked functional impairment. High risk for complications and comorbidity.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Severe, pervasive symptoms across all clusters
- Marked impairment in all life domains
- May be unable to care for self
- High risk for suicidality, substance use, other complications
- Often multiple comorbid conditions

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Immediate intervention required**
- Specialty mental health referral (if not already connected)
- Evidence-based trauma treatment with close monitoring
- Medication management strongly considered
- Close monitoring (at least weekly, possibly more frequent)
- Comprehensive safety assessment at each contact
- Consider higher level of care (IOP, PHP, inpatient) if:
  - Suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviors
  - Severe substance use compromising safety
  - Psychotic symptoms
  - Inability to care for self
  - Inadequate response to intensive outpatient care
- Coordinate care with primary care and other providers
- Family/support system involvement when appropriate

## DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Interpretation

**Provisional PTSD Diagnosis via PCL-5:**

Criteria met when:
1. **Cluster B (Intrusion):** At least 1 item rated ≥2
2. **Cluster C (Avoidance):** At least 1 item rated ≥2
3. **Cluster D (Negative cognitions/mood):** At least 2 items rated ≥2
4. **Cluster E (Arousal/reactivity):** At least 2 items rated ≥2

**IMPORTANT:** PCL-5 provides *provisional* diagnosis. Clinical interview required for formal diagnosis to assess:
- Trauma exposure meets Criterion A
- Duration of symptoms (>1 month)
- Functional impairment
- Symptoms not due to substances or medical condition

## Treatment Response Monitoring

### Minimal Response (< 5-point decrease)
**Interpretation:** No reliable change in symptoms

**Actions:**
- Reassess treatment plan and adherence
- Consider treatment intensification or modification
- Evaluate barriers to treatment engagement
- Rule out complicating factors (substance use, new trauma, safety issues)

### Reliable Improvement (5-9 point decrease)
**Interpretation:** Reliable change but not yet clinically significant

**Actions:**
- Continue current treatment approach
- Monitor progress closely
- Consider treatment intensification if progress plateaus
- Reinforce engagement and coping strategies

### Clinically Significant Improvement (10-20 point decrease)
**Interpretation:** Meaningful symptom reduction

**Actions:**
- Continue current treatment
- Begin planning for treatment completion and maintenance
- Develop relapse prevention strategies
- Discuss tapering medication if applicable

### Substantial Improvement (>20 point decrease)
**Interpretation:** Major symptom reduction

**Actions:**
- Continue treatment toward full recovery
- Transition to maintenance phase
- Relapse prevention planning
- Consider graduated treatment termination

## Cluster-Specific Patterns

### High Intrusion (Cluster B) Score
- Indicates prominent re-experiencing symptoms
- May respond well to exposure-based therapies
- Consider nightmares as specific treatment target

### High Avoidance (Cluster C) Score
- May interfere with trauma-focused treatment engagement
- Gradual exposure approach recommended
- Address avoidance patterns early in treatment

### High Negative Cognitions/Mood (Cluster D) Score
- Cognitive restructuring may be particularly beneficial
- Screen for comorbid depression
- May benefit from CPT or cognitive-focused interventions

### High Arousal/Reactivity (Cluster E) Score
- May benefit from anxiety management techniques
- Consider medication for physiological arousal
- Sleep disturbance often treatment target

## Special Considerations

### Trauma-Informed Approach
Regardless of score, use trauma-informed screening techniques. See [trauma-informed-approach.md](trauma-informed-approach.md) for detailed guidance.

### Comorbidity
PTSD commonly co-occurs with:
- Major depressive disorder (50% comorbidity)
- Substance use disorders (30-50% comorbidity)
- Anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic)
- Chronic pain conditions

Screen for comorbid conditions and address in treatment planning.

### Cultural Considerations
- Trauma expression varies across cultures
- Somatic symptoms may be more prominent in some cultural groups
- Use culturally adapted assessments when available
- Consider cultural context in symptom interpretation

### Complex Trauma/C-PTSD
PCL-5 assesses single-event PTSD. For complex trauma (prolonged, repeated trauma), consider:
- Additional assessment of self-concept disturbances
- Relationship difficulties beyond standard PTSD criteria
- Emotion regulation difficulties
- Refer to trauma specialist for complex presentations

## Safety Considerations

**Immediate Safety Concerns:**
Any indication of:
- Current suicidal ideation (screen with separate assessment)
- Self-harm behaviors
- Severe substance use
- Psychotic symptoms
- Homicidal ideation

Requires immediate intervention per [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)
