# Suicide Screening Tool Comparison

Guide for choosing between ASQ, C-SSRS, and PHQ-9 Item 9 for suicide screening.

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Suicide screening needed
    ↓
20 seconds available? (Medical setting, universal screening)
    ↓ YES → Use ASQ
    ↓ NO (have 5-15 minutes)
    ↓
    → Use C-SSRS for comprehensive assessment
    ↓
Already using PHQ-9 for depression?
    → Item 9 can trigger further assessment
```

## Tool Comparison

| Feature | ASQ | C-SSRS | PHQ-9 Item 9 |
|---------|-----|--------|--------------|
| **Items** | 4 (+1 acuity) | Multiple sections | 1 item |
| **Time** | 20 seconds | 5-15 minutes | Part of 2-3 min PHQ-9 |
| **Purpose** | Brief screening | Comprehensive assessment | Depression screening + suicide flag |

## ASQ (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions)

### When to Use

**Ideal settings:**
- Emergency department (universal screening)
- Inpatient medical/surgical units
- Primary care (quick screen)
- Any setting with limited time

**Advantages:**
- Extremely brief (20 seconds)
- Easy to administer
- Validated across ages 10+
- Good sensitivity

**Limitations:**
- Screen only, not assessment
- No risk level determination
- Positive screen requires follow-up with C-SSRS or clinical interview

**What it tells you:**
- Screen positive or negative
- Acuity (current thoughts vs. past)
- Lifetime attempts

**What it doesn't tell you:**
- Risk level
- Severity of ideation
- Plan details
- Protective factors

### Use ASQ For:
✓ Initial triage in busy settings
✓ Universal screening programs
✓ Medical patients

### Follow Positive ASQ With:
→ C-SSRS or comprehensive clinical interview

## C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale)

### When to Use

**Ideal settings:**
- Mental health specialty care
- Following positive brief screen
- When time permits comprehensive assessment
- Monitoring known suicide risk
- Research settings

**Advantages:**
- Comprehensive assessment
- Determines ideation severity (0-5)
- Assesses intensity (frequency, duration, control)
- Captures behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)
- Supports risk level determination
- Validated across ages, settings, populations

**Limitations:**
- Takes longer (5-15 minutes)
- Requires more training
- Can be overwhelming in crisis

**What it tells you:**
- Ideation severity level (0-5)
- Intensity of ideation
- Suicidal behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)
- Timeline (lifetime + recent)
- Supports risk level determination

**What it doesn't tell you alone:**
- Protective factors (must assess separately)
- Mental health diagnosis
- Definitive risk level (requires clinical judgment)

### Use C-SSRS For:
✓ Comprehensive suicide risk assessment
✓ Positive screen on ASQ or PHQ-9 Item 9
✓ Clinical concern despite negative screen
✓ Treatment monitoring for at-risk patients

## PHQ-9 Item 9

### When to Use

**Ideal settings:**
- When already screening for depression
- Mental health settings
- Primary care depression screening

**Advantages:**
- Part of standard depression screening
- Easy to add to routine care
- Can flag suicide risk during depression assessment

**Limitations:**
- Part of larger tool (not standalone suicide screen)
- Less specific ("hurting yourself" includes non-suicidal self-injury)
- No assessment of plan, intent, behavior
- Cannot determine risk level

**What it tells you:**
- Frequency of thoughts of death/self-harm (past 2 weeks)
- Triggers need for safety assessment if positive

**What it doesn't tell you:**
- If "hurting yourself" means suicide or self-injury
- Plan or intent
- Past attempts
- Risk level

### Use PHQ-9 Item 9 For:
✓ Flagging suicide concern during depression screening
✓ Not for standalone suicide screening

### Follow Positive Item 9 With:
→ Clarify if suicidal vs. self-injury
→ If suicidal: C-SSRS or ASQ then C-SSRS
→ See [../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md](../../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md)

## Recommended Workflows

### Emergency Department

```
All patients → ASQ (20 seconds)
    ↓
Negative → Provide 988, proceed with care
Positive → C-SSRS (comprehensive assessment)
    ↓
Determine risk level → Intervene accordingly
```

### Primary Care

**Option A: Brief + Comprehensive**
```
Universal screening → ASQ or PHQ-9 Item 9
    ↓
Positive → C-SSRS or refer for mental health evaluation
```

**Option B: If depression screening already done**
```
PHQ-9 administered → Item 9 positive?
    ↓
Yes → Clarify suicidal intent → C-SSRS if yes
```

### Mental Health Specialty

**Skip brief screens, go to comprehensive:**
```
Clinical concern or routine assessment → C-SSRS
```

### Inpatient Medical

```
Admission or clinical concern → ASQ
    ↓
Positive → Psych consult with C-SSRS
```

## Combining Tools

### ASQ + C-SSRS (Recommended)

**Two-stage approach:**
1. ASQ for quick triage (everyone)
2. C-SSRS for positive screens (targeted)

**Benefits:**
- Efficient use of time
- Comprehensive for those who need it

### PHQ-9 + C-SSRS

**When screening for depression:**
1. PHQ-9 (including Item 9)
2. If Item 9 positive → C-SSRS for full suicide assessment

**Benefits:**
- Integrates depression and suicide screening
- Ensures comprehensive follow-up

### Don't Mix ASQ and PHQ-9 Item 9

**Not recommended:**
- Redundant
- Use one or the other based on context

## Special Situations

### Very Limited Time

**Use:** ASQ (20 seconds)
**Minimum:** Ask "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"

### No Positive Screen But Clinical Concern

**Do:** Conduct full assessment (C-SSRS or clinical interview)
**Never:** Ignore clinical judgment based on negative screen

### Chronic Suicidal Ideation

**Use:** C-SSRS to assess changes from baseline
**Track:** Trends over time, acute changes

### Post-Discharge Monitoring

**Use:** C-SSRS at follow-up visits
**Frequency:** Every visit initially, then as clinically indicated

## Training Requirements

| Tool | Training Needed | Resources |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **ASQ** | Minimal (review materials) | NIMH website (free) |
| **C-SSRS** | Recommended (online training available) | cssrs.columbia.edu (free) |
| **PHQ-9 Item 9** | Minimal (+ safety protocol training) | Multiple sources |

## Which Tool When?

**Use ASQ when:**
- Need very quick screen (20 seconds)
- Universal screening in medical settings
- Limited staff training

**Use C-SSRS when:**
- Time permits (5-15 minutes)
- Comprehensive assessment needed
- Positive brief screen
- Mental health setting
- Monitoring suicide risk over time

**Use PHQ-9 Item 9 when:**
- Already doing depression screening
- Want integrated approach
- Then follow up with C-SSRS if positive

**Use clinical interview when:**
- Trained in suicide risk assessment
- Time allows
- Prefer clinical judgment over structured tool
- Complex case

## Key Principles

1. **Something is better than nothing**
   - Any suicide screening better than none
   - Use what fits your setting and time

2. **Brief screens require follow-up**
   - ASQ and PHQ-9 Item 9 are not assessments
   - Positive → comprehensive evaluation needed

3. **C-SSRS is gold standard for assessment**
   - Most comprehensive
   - Best for risk level determination
   - Requires more time

4. **Clinical judgment always needed**
   - No tool predicts suicide with certainty
   - Use tools to support, not replace, judgment
   - When uncertain, assess more thoroughly

5. **Screen negative doesn't mean no risk**
   - Patient may not disclose
   - Risk can change
   - Clinical concern trumps negative screen
