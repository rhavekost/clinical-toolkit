# Suicide Risk Assessment Protocol

Comprehensive clinical protocol for suicide risk assessment.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**Suicide risk assessment is a core clinical skill requiring training and clinical judgment. This protocol provides guidance but does NOT replace clinical training, supervision, and judgment.**

**Universal crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## When to Conduct Suicide Risk Assessment

### Always Assess When:
- Positive suicide screen (ASQ, C-SSRS, PHQ-9 Item 9)
- Patient reports suicidal ideation
- Recent suicide attempt or self-harm
- Significant clinical change in at-risk patient
- Discharge from psychiatric hospitalization
- Patient request for assessment
- Family/friend expresses concern

### Consider Assessing When:
- New diagnosis of major mental illness
- Severe depression, psychosis, or agitation
- Substance use disorder
- Chronic pain or terminal illness
- Recent significant loss
- High-risk demographics (previous attempt, LGBTQ+, veteran, etc.)
- Clinical intuition raises concern

### High-Risk Times:
- Immediately after positive screen
- Change in treatment (medication change, discharge from hospital)
- Anniversary of loss or trauma
- Major life stressor
- When patient "suddenly better" (may have made decision to die)

## Comprehensive Assessment Components

### 1. Current Suicidal Ideation

**Explore thoroughly:**

**Presence:**
- "Are you having thoughts of killing yourself?"
- "Do you have thoughts that life is not worth living?"
- "Do you wish you were dead?"

**Frequency:**
- "How often do you have these thoughts?"
- "When did they start?"
- "Are they getting more or less frequent?"

**Intensity:**
- "How strong are these thoughts?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how intense?"
- "How much of your day is taken up by these thoughts?"

**Duration:**
- "How long do the thoughts last when they occur?"
- "Do they come and go, or are they constant?"

**If ideation present → Continue detailed assessment**

### 2. Plan and Intent

**Plan:**
- "Have you thought about how you would do it?"
- "Do you have a specific plan?"
- "What method have you considered?"
- "Where would you do it?"
- "When would you do it?"

**Access to means:**
- "Do you have access to [stated method]?"
- "How would you get [method]?"
- For firearms: "Do you have a gun at home or access to one?"
- For medications: "Do you have medications you could overdose on?"

**Intent:**
- "Do you intend to act on these thoughts?"
- "How likely is it that you will act on these thoughts?"
- "What's stopping you from acting on these thoughts now?"
- "If nothing changed, would you act on these thoughts?"

**Imminence:**
- "When do you think you might act on these thoughts?"
- "Are you thinking about doing this today? Tonight? This week?"
- "How close have you come to acting on these thoughts?"

### 3. Suicidal Behavior History

**Previous attempts:**
- "Have you ever tried to kill yourself before?"
- If yes: "When was that?"
- "What did you do?"
- "What happened? (Did you get medical care? Were you hospitalized?)"
- "How many times have you attempted?"
- "When was the most recent attempt?"

**Assess lethality of past attempts:**
- Method used
- Medical severity of attempt
- Whether discovered by chance or planned to be found
- Patient's expectation of lethality ("Did you think you would die?")

**Recent preparatory behavior:**
- "Have you done anything to prepare?" (Collected pills, obtained weapon, written note, said goodbye, given away possessions, looked up methods online)
- "When did you do this?"

**Aborted or interrupted attempts:**
- "Have you started to harm yourself but stopped?"
- "Has someone or something stopped you from attempting?"

### 4. Protective Factors

**Assess what keeps patient safe:**

**Reasons for living:**
- "What are your reasons for living?"
- "What's important to you in your life?"
- Children, family, pets, responsibilities, religious beliefs, fear of death, hope for future

**Social support:**
- "Who do you feel connected to?"
- "Who can you talk to about your problems?"
- Family, friends, therapist, support groups, community

**Coping skills:**
- "What do you do when you're feeling distressed?"
- "What's helped you get through difficult times before?"

**Engagement in treatment:**
- "Are you seeing a therapist or psychiatrist?"
- "Are you taking medications as prescribed?"
- "How do you feel about your treatment?"

**Future orientation:**
- "Do you have things you're looking forward to?"
- "What are your plans for tomorrow? Next week?"

**Cultural/religious beliefs:**
- "Do your beliefs affect how you think about suicide?"
- "Does your faith provide support?"

### 5. Risk Factors

**Assess for known suicide risk factors:**

**Mental health:**
- Current diagnoses (depression, bipolar, psychosis, PTSD, anxiety, eating disorder, personality disorder)
- Severity of symptoms
- Treatment adherence
- Response to treatment
- Recent psychiatric hospitalization

**Substance use:**

- Bullying or discrimination
- Access to firearms

**Demographics:**
- Male (higher lethality of attempts)

### 7. Specific High-Risk Features

**Assess for:**

**Hopelessness:**
- "Do you feel hopeless about the future?"
- "Do you think things will ever get better?"
- Strong predictor of suicide

**Psychache (psychological pain):**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how much emotional pain are you in?"
- Unbearable psychological pain drives suicide

**Agitation:**
- Restlessness, can't sit still, intense anxiety
- Increases risk of impulsive action

**Impulsivity:**
- "Do you act on impulse without thinking?"
- History of impulsive behavior

**Perceived burdensomeness:**
- "Do you feel like a burden to others?"
- "Do you think others would be better off without you?"

**Social disconnection:**
- "Do you feel alone or isolated?"
- "Do you feel like you don't belong?"

**Recent discharge:**
- First weeks after psychiatric hospital discharge are highest risk

**Command hallucinations:**
- "Do you hear voices telling you to hurt yourself?"

## Risk Level Determination

See [risk-levels.md](risk-levels.md) for detailed risk level descriptions.

**Integrate all assessment data:**
- Ideation (presence, frequency, intensity, duration)
- Plan and intent (specificity, access to means, imminence)
- Behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)
- Protective factors (strength and accessibility)
- Risk factors (number and severity)
- Mental status (hopelessness, agitation, psychosis)

**Clinical judgment is essential:**
- Risk level not determined by score or checklist alone
- Weight given to clinical presentation
- Consider trajectory (improving vs. deteriorating)
- When uncertain, consult

**See [risk-levels.md](risk-levels.md) for:**
- Low risk criteria and management
- Moderate risk criteria and management
- High risk criteria and management
- Imminent risk criteria and management

## Special Populations

### Adolescents
- Use age-appropriate language
- Assess peer relationships, school, social media
- Involve parents (balance with teen privacy)
- Higher impulsivity - lower threshold for safety interventions

### Older Adults
- Don't avoid asking due to age
- Assess medical illness burden, loss, isolation
- Higher lethality of attempts
- May underreport due to stigma

### LGBTQ+ Individuals
- Assess minority stress, discrimination
- Family acceptance important protective factor
- Specific crisis resources (Trevor Project)

### Veterans
- Combat exposure, PTSD
- Access to firearms common
- Veterans Crisis Line
- VA mental health services

### Psychosis
- Command hallucinations to harm self
- Reality testing impaired
- May need hospitalization for safety

### Substance Use
- Assess current intoxication
- Substances increase impulsivity
- May need detox before accurate assessment

### Chronic Pain/Medical Illness
- "Life not worth living with this pain" warrants full assessment
- Address both condition and suicidal ideation
- Palliative care may help

## After Assessment

### All Risk Levels:
- Create safety plan (see [safety-planning.md](safety-planning.md))
- Provide crisis resources
- Document thoroughly
- Communicate with treatment team
- Plan for follow-up

### Moderate-High Risk:
- Remove lethal means
- Increase monitoring frequency
- Same-day psychiatric evaluation
- Involve support system
- Consider higher level of care

### High-Imminent Risk:
- Do not leave alone
- Emergency psychiatric evaluation
- Call 988 or crisis team
- Likely hospitalization
- May need police for transport

## Consultation

**Always consult when:**
- High or imminent risk
- Uncertain about risk level
- Patient refuses safety planning
- First time assessing suicidal patient
- Complex case
- Considering hospitalization
- Your gut tells you something is wrong

**Who to consult:**
- Clinical supervisor
- Psychiatry
- Crisis team
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (for consultation)

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Duty to Protect
Clinicians have duty to protect patients from self-harm, which may include:
- Warning family (with or without consent in emergency)
- Involuntary hospitalization
- Breaking confidentiality when necessary for safety

### Documentation Protects
- Thorough assessment and documentation
- Shows standard of care followed
- Clinical reasoning documented
- Consultation obtained when needed

### Cannot Predict with Certainty
- Suicide risk assessment identifies risk factors
- Cannot predict individual behavior with certainty
- Use assessment to guide interventions
- Focus on prevention, not prediction

## Self-Care for Clinicians

**Assessing suicide risk is stressful:**
- Use supervision and consultation
- Debrief after high-risk assessments
- Recognize your emotional reactions
- Set boundaries
- Know your limits
- Seek support

**If patient dies by suicide:**
- Not your fault (many factors contribute)
- Seek supervision and support
- Psychological autopsy can help understand
- Professional support essential

## Key Principles

1. **Ask directly** - Asking does not increase risk
2. **Take all disclosures seriously** - Even if patient minimizes later
3. **Clinical judgment essential** - No tool or protocol replaces judgment
4. **When uncertain, err on side of safety** - Better safe than sorry
5. **Consultation is strength** - Not weakness
6. **Document thoroughly** - If not documented, didn't happen (legally)
7. **Risk can change rapidly** - Reassess frequently
8. **Means restriction saves lives** - Especially firearms
9. **Safety plans work** - Evidence-based intervention
10. **Self-care matters** - Can't help others if you're not okay

## Training and Competence

**Recommended training:**
- Suicide risk assessment course
- C-SSRS training (free online)
- Safety planning training
- Crisis intervention training
- Consultation with experienced clinicians

**Maintain competence:**
- Regular supervision
- Continuing education
- Stay current with literature
- Practice with supervision
- Use consultation liberally
