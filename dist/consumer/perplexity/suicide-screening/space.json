  "instructions": "# Suicide Risk Screening\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill helps administer and interpret validated suicide risk screening instruments. The ASQ provides a brief initial screening, while the C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) offers comprehensive assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\n**Clinical Context:** These tools help identify individuals at risk for suicide, assess severity of suicidal thinking, and guide clinical decision-making about safety interventions. They are support tools that supplement, not replace, comprehensive suicide risk assessment and clinical judgment.\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE\n\n**ANY positive suicide screen requires IMMEDIATE action. DO NOT leave patient alone. Comprehensive risk assessment and safety planning required before patient leaves your care.**\n\n**Universal crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Assessment Comparison\n\n| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | When Positive | When to Use |\n|------------|-------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| **ASQ** | 4 (+1 acuity) | 20 sec | Brief screening | Any \"yes\" | Quick triage, medical settings |\n| **C-SSRS** | Multiple sections | 5-15 min | Comprehensive assessment | Determines risk level | Full assessment, positive ASQ |\n\n**For detailed comparison:** See [references/screening-comparison.md](references/screening-comparison.md)\n\n### Risk Level Quick Reference\n\n| Risk Level | Ideation | Plan/Intent | Behavior | Immediate Action |\n|------------|----------|-------------|----------|------------------|\n| **Low** | Passive or none | None | None recent | Safety plan, 1-week follow-up |\n| **Moderate** | Active, vague | Uncertain | Past attempt (not recent) | Same-day eval, intensive monitoring |\n| **High** | Active, specific | Intent present | Recent attempt/preparatory | Psychiatric hospitalization likely |\n| **Imminent** | Active, immediate | Has means, immediate intent | Attempt in progress | Call 911, emergency hospitalization |\n\n**For detailed risk levels:** See [references/risk-levels.md](references/risk-levels.md)\n\n## Assessment Tools\n\n### ASQ (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions)\n\n**Complete assessment:** [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md)\n\n**4 questions (20 sec), Ages 10+.** Any \"yes\" = positive → comprehensive assessment required.\n\n**Questions:** (1) Wished dead? (2) Family better off without you? (3) Thoughts of killing yourself? (4) Ever tried?\n**If positive → Ask:** \"Thoughts right now?\"\n\n### C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale)\n\n**Complete assessment:** [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md)\n\n**5-15 minutes.** Multiple sections: ideation (severity 0-5), intensity, behavior (attempts, prep acts), timeline. Determines risk level with clinical judgment.\n\n## Clinical Workflow\n\n### 1. Choose Assessment\n\n```dot\ndigraph assessment_selection {\n    rankdir=LR;\n    node [shape=box, style=rounded];\n\n    start [label=\"Need Suicide\\nScreening\", shape=ellipse];\n    time_check [label=\"Time\\navailable?\", shape=diamond];\n    phq9_check [label=\"PHQ-9 Item 9\\npositive?\", shape=diamond];\n    asq [label=\"Start with\\nASQ\\n(20 sec)\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=lightblue];\n    asq_result [label=\"ASQ\\nPositive?\", shape=diamond];\n    cssrs [label=\"C-SSRS\\nFull Assessment\\n(5-15 min)\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=orange];\n    negative [label=\"Negative Screen\\n(Still assess\\nclinically)\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=gray90];\n\n    start -> time_check;\n    time_check -> asq [label=\"<1 min\"];\n    time_check -> phq9_check [label=\"5-15 min\\navailable\"];\n    phq9_check -> cssrs [label=\"yes\"];\n    phq9_check -> cssrs [label=\"no\\n(suspected\\nrisk)\"];\n    asq -> asq_result;\n    asq_result -> cssrs [label=\"yes\"];\n    asq_result -> negative [label=\"no\"];\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Administer Assessment\n\n**ASQ:** [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md) - 4 questions, 20 seconds\n**C-SSRS:** [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md) - Multiple sections, 5-15 minutes\n\n### 3. Determine Risk Level\n\n#### Risk Assessment Decision Tree\n\n```dot\ndigraph risk_determination {\n    rankdir=TB;\n    node [shape=box, style=rounded];\n\n    ideation [label=\"Suicidal\\nIdeation?\", shape=diamond];\n    passive [label=\"Passive Only\\n(wishes to die)\", shape=diamond];\n    active [label=\"Active Ideation\\n(thoughts of\\nkilling self)\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=yellow];\n\n    plan_intent [label=\"Plan AND\\nIntent?\", shape=diamond];\n    means [label=\"Access to\\nMeans?\", shape=diamond];\n    recent_behavior [label=\"Recent\\nAttempt/Prep?\", shape=diamond];\n    immediate [label=\"Imminent\\nPlan?\", shape=diamond];\n\n    low [label=\"LOW RISK\\n• Safety plan\\n• 1-week f/u\\n• Resources\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=lightgreen];\n    moderate [label=\"MODERATE\\n• Same-day eval\\n• Safety planning\\n• Remove means\\n• Close monitoring\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=yellow];\n    high [label=\"HIGH RISK\\n• Psychiatric eval\\n• Hospitalization\\n  likely\\n• Do not leave\\n  alone\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=orange];\n    imminent [label=\"IMMINENT\\n• Call 911\\n• Emergency\\n  hospitalization\\n• Constant\\n  observation\", style=\"filled\", fillcolor=red, fontcolor=white];\n\n    ideation -> passive [label=\"yes\"];\n    ideation -> low [label=\"no\\n(denied)\"];\n    passive -> low [label=\"yes\"];\n    passive -> active [label=\"no\\n(active)\"];\n    active -> plan_intent;\n    plan_intent -> recent_behavior [label=\"no\"];\n    plan_intent -> means [label=\"yes\"];\n    means -> immediate [label=\"yes\"];\n    means -> high [label=\"no\"];\n    immediate -> imminent [label=\"yes\"];\n    immediate -> high [label=\"no\"];\n    recent_behavior -> moderate [label=\"no\"];\n    recent_behavior -> high [label=\"yes\"];\n}\n```\n\n**Use comprehensive protocol:**\n→ [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)\n\n**Integrate all factors:**\n- Ideation (presence, frequency, intensity)\n- Plan and intent (specificity, access to means)\n- Behavior (attempts, preparatory acts)\n- Protective factors (reasons for living, social support)\n- Risk factors (prior attempts, mental illness, substance use)\n- Mental status (hopelessness, agitation, impulsivity)\n\n**Risk levels:** See [references/risk-levels.md](references/risk-levels.md)\n\n### 4. Immediate Safety Interventions\n\n**ALL risk levels:**\n- Create safety plan (see [references/safety-planning.md](references/safety-planning.md))\n- Provide crisis resources\n- Remove means when possible\n- Document thoroughly\n\n**Moderate-High risk:**\n- Same-day psychiatric evaluation\n- Intensive monitoring\n- Remove ALL lethal means\n- Involve support system\n\n**High-Imminent risk:**\n- Call 911 or crisis team\n- DO NOT leave alone\n- Emergency hospitalization\n\n### 5. Document\n\n**Use documentation templates in:**\n- [assets/asq.md](assets/asq.md#documentation-template)\n- [assets/c-ssrs.md](assets/c-ssrs.md#documentation-template)\n- [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md#documentation)\n\n**Documentation standards:** [../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md](../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md)\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS\n\n**ANY positive response:** (1) DO NOT leave patient alone, (2) Comprehensive assessment, (3) Assess plan/intent/means, (4) Remove lethal means, (5) Determine risk level, (6) Intervene appropriately, (7) Document thoroughly, (8) Ensure continuous safety.\n\n**Essential questions:** Plan? Access to means? Intent to act? When? What's kept you safe? Prior attempts? **Complete protocol:** [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)\n\n**Crisis resources (provide ALL patients):** 988 Lifeline (call/text), Text HOME to 741741, Veterans: 988 press 1 or text 838255, Trevor Project (LGBTQ+ youth): 1-866-488-7386, Emergency: 911.\n\n**Safety planning (required all risk levels):** Warning signs, coping strategies, distraction, support contacts, crisis services, means restriction, reasons for living. **Guide:** [references/safety-planning.md](references/safety-planning.md)\n\n**Means restriction (CRITICAL, saves lives):** Firearms—remove completely (preferred) or lock separately from ammunition with someone else controlling access. Medications—remove excess, family/pharmacy holds, weekly dispensing. Other—remove based on plan (ropes, cords, chemicals).\n\n**NEVER:** Leave patient alone, assume others will handle, accept \"I'm fine\" without assessment, discharge without safety plan, minimize suicidal statements, skip means restriction, use \"no-suicide contracts\" (not evidence-based).\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n**High-risk populations:** Adolescents (impulsivity, social media), LGBTQ+ individuals (minority stress), veterans (combat trauma, firearm access), older adults (isolation, higher lethality), post-discharge patients (first weeks post-hospitalization).\n\n**Screen when:** Severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥15), psychosis, substance use, PTSD, chronic pain, terminal illness, recent loss. See [PHQ-9 Item 9 protocol](../depression-screening/references/item-9-safety-protocol.md).\n\n**Cultural:** Ask directly across cultures; expression varies; use interpreters; understand protective factors.\n\n## Referral Guidelines\n\n### When to Refer/Hospitalize\n\n**Immediate (Emergency Services/911):**\n- Imminent risk (plan, intent, means, immediate)\n- Attempt in progress\n- Cannot keep self safe\n- Psychosis with command hallucinations\n\n**Urgent (Same-Day Psychiatric Evaluation):**\n- High risk (plan and intent but not imminent)\n- Moderate risk unable to safety plan\n- Recent attempt (past week)\n\n**Routine (Within 1-3 Days):**\n- Low risk needing mental health treatment\n- Moderate risk with good safety plan\n- Follow-up after higher level of care\n\n**Complete referral guidance:** [../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md](../../docs/references/referral-guidelines.md)\n\n## Limitations\n\n**Cannot predict suicide with certainty.** Patients may not disclose; risk changes rapidly. Tools support clinical judgment, not replace it. Negative screen ≠ no risk. When in doubt: assess thoroughly, consult, err on side of safety.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n**Example requests:** \"Screen for suicide risk\", \"ASQ positive—what now?\", \"Guide C-SSRS\", \"Create safety plan\", \"Assess risk level\"\n\n## References\n\n**Primary Literature:**\n- Horowitz LM, et al.
