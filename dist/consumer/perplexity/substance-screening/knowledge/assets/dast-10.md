# Drug Abuse Screening Test - 10 Item (DAST-10)

## Overview
- **Items:** 10
- **Time:** 2-3 minutes
- **Purpose:** Screen for drug use problems and potential substance use disorder
- **Population:** Adults (18+), general medical and mental health settings
- **Response Format:** Binary (Yes/No)
- **Timeframe:** Past 12 months

## Items

The following questions concern information about your possible involvement with drugs **not including alcoholic beverages** during the past 12 months.

**"Drug abuse" refers to:**
- Prescription drugs used in excess of directions
- Non-prescription drugs
- Illegal drugs (cannabis, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, hallucinogens, etc.)

**Response Scale:**
- No = 0 points
- Yes = 1 point

**Questions:**

1. Have you used drugs other than those required for medical reasons?
2. Do you abuse more than one drug at a time?
3. Are you always able to stop using drugs when you want to? **(Reverse scored: Yes = 0, No = 1)**
4. Have you had "blackouts" or "flashbacks" as a result of drug use?
5. Do you ever feel bad or guilty about your drug use?
6. Does your spouse (or parents) ever complain about your involvement with drugs?
7. Have you neglected your family because of your use of drugs?
8. Have you engaged in illegal activities in order to obtain drugs?
9. Have you ever experienced withdrawal symptoms (felt sick) when you stopped taking drugs?
10. Have you had medical problems as a result of your drug use (e.g., memory loss, hepatitis, convulsions, bleeding, etc.)?

**IMPORTANT - Item 3 Scoring:**
Item 3 is reverse scored:
- Answer "Yes" (able to stop) = 0 points
- Answer "No" (not able to stop) = 1 point

## Scoring

**Algorithm:**
1. Score 1 point for "Yes" responses (except Item 3)
2. Score 1 point for "No" response on Item 3 only
3. Sum all points
4. Total score range: 0-10
5. Higher scores indicate greater drug use problems

**Interpretation:**

- **0:** No problems reported
- **1-2:** Low level of drug-related problems
- **3-5:** Moderate level (suggests substance use disorder)
- **6-8:** Substantial level (likely substance use disorder)
- **9-10:** Severe level (severe substance use disorder)

**Clinical Cutoffs:**
- **0-2:** Negative screen - Low risk, no intervention typically needed
- **≥3:** Positive screen - Indicates problematic drug use, further assessment recommended
- **≥6:** High severity - Strong indication for specialty substance use treatment

For detailed severity interpretations and treatment recommendations, see [references/severity-levels.md](../references/severity-levels.md) and [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](../references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Cutoff ≥3: Optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity for substance use disorder
- High internal consistency (α = 0.92)
- Correlates well with DSM substance use disorder criteria
- Brief enough for primary care settings
- Sensitive to treatment changes

## Risk Categories

### No/Minimal Risk (0-2)
**Clinical Meaning:** No significant drug-related problems

**Typical Presentation:**
- No drug use or very infrequent recreational use
- No functional impairment
- No negative consequences

**Recommended Actions:**
- Provide positive feedback
- Brief education on risks
- Routine monitoring
- Reassess if concerns arise

### Moderate Risk (3-5)
**Clinical Meaning:** Moderate level of drug-related problems suggesting possible substance use disorder

**Typical Presentation:**
- Regular drug use with some consequences
- Some functional impairment
- May meet criteria for mild-moderate substance use disorder
- Patient may not recognize problem severity

**Recommended Actions:**
- Comprehensive substance use assessment
- Screen for specific substances used
- Motivational interviewing/brief intervention
- Assess readiness to change
- Referral to outpatient treatment if appropriate
- Rule out medical complications
- Screen for co-occurring mental health disorders

### Substantial Risk (6-8)
**Clinical Meaning:** Substantial drug problems likely indicating substance use disorder requiring treatment

**Typical Presentation:**
- Frequent, heavy drug use
- Significant functional impairment
- Multiple negative consequences
- May have withdrawal symptoms
- Likely meets criteria for moderate-severe substance use disorder

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Specialty substance use treatment referral required**
- Comprehensive assessment for specific substances
- Evaluate for medication-assisted treatment (if opioid use disorder)
- Assess withdrawal risk
- Address medical complications
- Screen for infectious diseases (HIV, Hepatitis C if injection drug use)
- Comprehensive mental health assessment
- Coordinate care with specialists

### Severe Risk (9-10)
**Clinical Meaning:** Severe substance use disorder with extensive problems requiring immediate intervention

**Typical Presentation:**
- Heavy, chronic drug use
- Severe functional impairment in all life domains
- Multiple serious consequences (medical, legal, social)
- High risk for overdose
- Likely physiological dependence with withdrawal

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Immediate specialty referral**
- Consider higher level of care:
  - Medically supervised detoxification if needed
  - Residential treatment program
  - Intensive outpatient program (IOP)
  - Partial hospitalization program (PHP)
- Comprehensive medical evaluation
- Address acute medical complications
- Infectious disease screening
- Medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder
- Close monitoring
- Case management
- Family involvement when appropriate

## Substance-Specific Considerations

**If DAST-10 positive, assess specific substances:**

### Opioids (prescription painkillers, heroin, fentanyl)
- **High risk for:** Overdose, respiratory depression, infectious diseases
- **Treatment options:** Medication-assisted treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone)
- **Harm reduction:** Naloxone (Narcan) prescription, safe injection education
- **Monitor for:** Withdrawal symptoms (can begin treatment), overdose risk

### Stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription stimulants)
- **High risk for:** Cardiovascular complications, psychosis, severe depression
- **Treatment options:** Behavioral therapies, contingency management
- **Monitor for:** Cardiac symptoms, psychiatric complications, crash phase

### Cannabis
- **Assessment:** Distinguish daily use from occasional use, assess impairment
- **Treatment:** Often behavioral interventions
- **Consider:** May be medicinal use in some states, assess problematic use patterns

### Sedatives/Benzodiazepines
- **High risk for:** Dangerous withdrawal, overdose (especially with opioids)
- **Treatment caution:** Medically supervised taper required, do not abrupt discontinuation
- **Monitor for:** Withdrawal seizure risk

### Hallucinogens/Other substances
- **Assess:** Patterns, frequency, associated risks
- **Treatment:** Typically behavioral interventions
