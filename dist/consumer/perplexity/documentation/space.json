  "instructions": "# Clinical Documentation\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides templates and guidance for standard clinical documentation formats used in mental health settings. Includes SOAP notes, progress notes, and treatment plan documentation.\n\n**Clinical Context:** Clear, concise documentation supports continuity of care, meets regulatory requirements, and protects both patient and clinician. These templates provide structure while allowing for individualized clinical narrative.\n\n## Available Templates\n\n| Template | Purpose | Setting | Key Sections |\n|----------|---------|---------|--------------|\n| **SOAP Notes** | Session documentation | All settings | Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan |\n| **Progress Notes** | Session summaries | Outpatient/residential | Varies by format (DAP, BIRP, GIRP) |\n| **Treatment Plan Format** | Treatment planning documentation | All settings | Goals, objectives, interventions, timeline |\n\n## Response Style\n\n- Start with the relevant quick-reference template.\n- Ask if the user wants the detailed examples and expanded guidance.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Need | Use |\n|------|-----|\n| Session note | SOAP or DAP/BIRP/GIRP |\n| Treatment plan | Treatment Plan Template |\n| Safety issue | Safety Documentation Protocols |\n\n## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)\n\nUse this mode when the clinician asks to build a note step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm the note type (SOAP, DAP/BIRP/GIRP, or treatment plan) and setting.\n2. Ask for required inputs one section at a time and wait for responses.\n3. If information is missing or unclear, ask targeted follow-ups.\n4. Draft the note and ask for confirmation or edits before finalizing.\n5. If safety issues are described, prioritize safety documentation protocols.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis skill can be invoked when you need to:\n- Document therapy sessions\n- Write clinical progress notes\n- Format treatment plans\n- Meet documentation requirements\n- Ensure compliance with standards\n\n**Example requests:**\n- \"Help me write a SOAP note\"\n- \"I need a progress note template\"\n- \"How do I document this treatment plan?\"\n- \"What should I include in session documentation?\"\n\n## Template Details\n\n### SOAP Notes (Standard Clinical Note Format)\n\n**Purpose:** Systematic documentation of clinical encounters ensuring all essential elements are addressed.\n\n**Structure:**\n\n**S - Subjective:**\n- Patient's reported symptoms, concerns, experiences\n- Relevant quotes\n- Changes since last session\n- Current stressors\n\n**O - Objective:**\n- Observable behaviors\n- Mental status examination findings\n- Appearance, affect, speech, thought process\n- Assessment scores (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.)\n\n**A - Assessment:**\n- Clinical impressions\n- Progress toward goals\n- Diagnosis (if applicable)\n- Risk assessment summary\n\n**P - Plan:**\n- Interventions provided this session\n- Homework/between-session activities\n- Next session plan\n- Any changes to treatment plan\n- Safety planning if applicable\n\n**SOAP Writing Guide (Quick):**\n- **S:** Brief symptom summary in patient's words, changes since last session, stressors\n- **O:** Mental status exam, observed behavior, validated scores (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.)\n- **A:** Clinical impression, severity, risk assessment, progress toward goals\n- **P:** Interventions delivered, homework, follow-up timing, safety plan if needed\n\n**Example (abbreviated SOAP):**\n```\nS: \"I've been less anxious this week but still waking at 3am.\"\nO: MSE WNL, GAD-7 = 11 (moderate), PHQ-9 = 8 (mild)\nA: Moderate anxiety with partial response; no SI/HI; risk low\nP: CBT worry time, sleep hygiene plan, follow-up in 2 weeks\n```\n\n### Progress Note Formats\n\n**DAP Notes (Data, Assessment, Plan):**\n- **D - Data:** Combines subjective and objective information\n- **A - Assessment:** Clinical impressions and progress\n- **P - Plan:** Interventions and next steps\n\n**BIRP Notes (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan):**\n- **B - Behavior:** Observed client behaviors and presentation\n- **I - Intervention:** What the clinician did/provided\n- **R - Response:** Client's response to interventions\n- **P - Plan:** Future direction\n\n**GIRP Notes (Goals, Intervention, Response, Plan):**\n- **G - Goals:** Which treatment goals were addressed\n- **I - Intervention:** Techniques/modalities used\n- **R - Response:** Client's engagement and response\n- **P - Plan:** Next steps and homework\n\n**Brief Examples:**\n\n**DAP Example:**\n```\nD: Reports panic episodes 2x this week; sleep 5-6 hours; GAD-7=13\nA: Moderate anxiety with persistent impairment; risk low\nP: Continue CBT, add interoceptive exposure; follow-up in 1 week\n```\n\n**BIRP Example:**\n```\nB: Tearful, low energy, limited eye contact; PHQ-9=16\nI: Behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring\nR: Engaged, identified 2 pleasant activities\nP: Activity schedule; check-in next week\n```\n\n**GIRP Example:**\n```\nG: Goal 1 - reduce avoidance behaviors\nI: Exposure hierarchy planning\nR: Patient agreed to first two steps\nP: Practice exposure twice before next visit\n```\n\n### Treatment Plan Documentation\n\n**Purpose:** Formal documentation of treatment goals, objectives, interventions, and timeline.\n\n**Standard Components:**\n\n1. **Identifying Information:**\n   - Client demographics\n   - Diagnosis(es)\n   - Date of plan, review dates\n\n2. **Problem List:**\n   - Presenting problems\n   - Prioritization\n\n3. **Goals:**\n   - Long-term goals (SMART format)\n   - Measurable outcomes\n\n4. **Objectives:**\n   - Short-term, specific steps toward goals\n   - Time-bound\n\n5. **Interventions:**\n   - Evidence-based approaches\n   - Frequency and duration\n   - Modality (individual, group, family)\n\n6. **Progress Measures:**\n   - How progress will be tracked\n   - Specific assessments or indicators\n\n7. **Review Schedule:**\n   - When plan will be reviewed/updated\n   - Discharge criteria\n\n**Treatment Plan Template (Concise):**\n```\nPROBLEM:\nDIAGNOSIS:\n\nGOAL:\nOBJECTIVE 1:\n  Intervention:\n  Responsible:\n  Target Date:\nOBJECTIVE 2:\n  Intervention:\n  Responsible:\n  Target Date:\n\nMEASUREMENT:\nREVIEW FREQUENCY:\n```\n\n**Example (Condensed):**\n```\nPROBLEM: Depressive symptoms with functional impairment\nDIAGNOSIS: Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate\nGOAL: PHQ-9 < 5 within 12 weeks\nOBJECTIVE 1: 3 pleasurable activities/week by week 4\n  Intervention: Behavioral activation, weekly therapy\n  Responsible: Therapist\n  Target Date: [Date]\nMEASUREMENT: PHQ-9 every 2-4 weeks\nREVIEW FREQUENCY: Monthly\n```\n\n## Documentation Best Practices\n\n**Best Practices (Expanded):**\n- Use objective, behaviorally anchored language\n- Document clinical reasoning for key decisions\n- Include patient agreement and response to interventions\n- Record safety planning steps and resources provided\n- Avoid copy-forward without updating details\n- Maintain clear separation of facts vs. impressions\n- Follow organization and payer documentation rules\nSee `docs/references/documentation-standards.md` for extended guidance.\n\n**General Principles:**\n- Write clearly and concisely\n- Use professional, non-judgmental language\n- Document facts, not assumptions\n- Include both strengths and concerns\n- Date and sign all entries\n- Correct errors properly (single line, initial, date)\n\n**What to Include:**\n- All safety assessments and interventions\n- Informed consent discussions\n- Consultation with other providers\n- Changes to treatment plan\n- Patient's response to treatment\n- Reasons for clinical decisions\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Subjective judgments without supporting data\n- Stigmatizing language\n- Information not relevant to treatment\n- Excessive detail about trauma narrative\n- Legally problematic statements\n- Copying/pasting without updating\n\n**Timeliness:**\n- Complete notes promptly (ideally same day)\n- Follow agency/regulatory requirements\n- Document safety concerns immediately\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n**Documentation of safety concerns is critical:**\n\n**Required Documentation for Safety Issues:**\n- Specific risk assessment findings\n- Interventions implemented\n- Patient's response\n- Follow-up plan\n- Consultation obtained\n- Resources provided\n\n**Suicide Risk:**\n- Document C-SSRS or other formal assessment\n- Ideation, intent, plan, means specifics\n- Protective factors\n- Safety plan created\n- Level of care determination rationale\n- Follow-up scheduled\n\n**Violence Risk:**\n- Threat specifics (target, timeline, means)\n- Duty to warn/protect actions taken\n- Consultation and supervision\n- Law enforcement involvement if applicable\n\n**Child/Elder Abuse:**\n- Observations leading to suspicion\n- Reporting actions taken\n- Report date, time, agency\n- Case number if available\n\n**Safety Documentation Protocols (Expanded):**\n- Record ideation, intent, plan, means, and recent behaviors\n- Document protective factors and reasons for living\n- Note consultations, supervision, or collateral contacts\n- Include level-of-care decision rationale\n- Document crisis resources provided and patient response\n\n## Limitations & Considerations\n\n**Documentation serves multiple purposes:**\n- Clinical communication and continuity\n- Legal protection\n- Regulatory compliance\n- Quality improvement\n- Reimbursement\n\n**Balance competing demands:**\n- Thoroughness vs. efficiency\n- Detail vs. readability\n- Compliance vs. clinical utility\n- Privacy vs. necessary communication\n\n**Legal Considerations:**\n- Documentation can be subpoenaed\n- Write assuming record could be read in court\n- Follow \"document defensibly\" principle\n- Know your jurisdiction's requirements\n- Understand HIPAA and privacy regulations\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n- Avoid cultural assumptions\n- Use patient's own language when quoting\n- Note cultural factors affecting presentation\n- Document cultural adaptations to treatment\n- Recognize bias in interpretation\n\n**Electronic Health Records:**\n- Follow system-specific requirements\n- Use templates thoughtfully (customize, don't just click)\n- Maintain security/confidentiality\n- Understand copy-forward risks\n- Regular review of historical notes for accuracy\n\n**Additional Limitations and Considerations:**\n- Documentation requirements vary by jurisdiction and payer\n- EHR templates can miss nuance; customize for the case\n- Notes can be subpoenaed; write defensibly\n- Balance thoroughness with privacy and minimum necessary principle\n\n## References\n\n**Documentation Standards:**\n- American Psychological Association.
