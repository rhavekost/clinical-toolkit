# Mini-Cog

## Purpose
Brief cognitive screening using a 3-item recall test and clock drawing.

## Intended Population
Older adults in primary care or acute care settings.

## Inputs
1. **Three-word registration** (immediate recall)
2. **Clock drawing test** (set hands to a specified time)
3. **Three-word recall** (after clock draw)

## Scoring
- **Three-word recall:** 0 to 3 points (1 point per word recalled)
- **Clock draw:** 0 or 2 points (normal clock = 2)

Total score range: 0 to 5.

## Interpretation
- **0 to 2:** positive screen for cognitive impairment
- **3 to 5:** negative screen (lower likelihood of dementia)

## Clock Draw Guidance
A normal clock includes all numbers in correct order and position and hands set to the requested time.

## Limitations
- A screening tool; not diagnostic.
- Performance can be affected by education, language, or motor impairment.

## Licensing Note
Mini-Cog is free to use for clinical and educational purposes without permission.
