# Ottawa Knee Rules

## Purpose
Determine the need for knee radiographs after acute knee injury.

## Intended Population

| Inability to flex knee to 90 degrees | 1 | - |
| Inability to bear weight (4 steps) immediately and in ED | 1 | 4 steps both immediately and in ED |

## Algorithm
If **any** criterion is present, knee radiograph is indicated.

## Output

## Interpretation
