# Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ)

## Overview
- **Items:** 4 core questions + 1 acuity question
- **Time:** 20 seconds
- **Purpose:** Brief suicide risk screening in medical settings
- **Population:** Ages 10+
- **Use:** Emergency departments, primary care, medical/surgical units

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**ANY "yes" response requires immediate follow-up with comprehensive suicide risk assessment (C-SSRS or clinical interview).**

**Universal crisis protocols:** See [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## The 4 ASQ Questions

**Ask directly, clearly, and with empathy:**

1. **"In the past few weeks, have you wished you were dead?"**

2. **"In the past few weeks, have you felt that you or your family would be better off if you were dead?"**

3. **"In the past week, have you been having thoughts about killing yourself?"**

4. **"Have you ever tried to kill yourself?"**
   - If yes: "When?"
   - If within the past 3 months → Higher risk

## Acuity Question

**If ANY of the 4 questions is "yes":**

5. **"Are you having thoughts of killing yourself right now?"**

## Scoring and Interpretation

### Result

**Positive Screen:**
- Any "yes" response to questions 1-4

**Negative Screen:**
- All "no" responses to questions 1-4

### Risk Level

**Higher immediate risk if:**
- "Yes" to question 5 (current suicidal thoughts)
- Recent attempt (question 4 yes + within 3 months)

**See [references/risk-levels.md](../references/risk-levels.md) for detailed risk categorization**

## Clinical Actions

### If Negative Screen (All "No")

- Patient screened negative for suicide risk
- Can proceed with medical care
- Provide crisis resources (988) for future
- Reassess if clinical picture changes

### If Positive Screen (Any "Yes")

**REQUIRED next steps:**

1. **Do not leave patient alone**
2. **Conduct comprehensive suicide risk assessment:**
   - Use C-SSRS (see [c-ssrs.md](c-ssrs.md))
   - OR thorough clinical suicide risk assessment
   - See [../references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](../references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)

3. **Determine risk level** (low, moderate, high, imminent)

4. **Intervene based on risk:**
   - All levels: Safety plan, crisis resources, follow-up
   - Moderate-High: Same-day psychiatric evaluation
   - Imminent: Emergency services, do not discharge

5. **Document thoroughly**

### If "Yes" to Acuity Question (#5)

**Current suicidal ideation = IMMEDIATE action:**
- Patient safety is priority
- May need one-to-one observation
- Psychiatric evaluation before medical discharge
- Consider emergency department or crisis services
- Remove means of self-harm

## Documentation Template

```
**Assessment:** ASQ (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions)
**Date:** [Date/Time]
**Patient:** [Name/ID]
**Setting:** [ED/Primary Care/Inpatient Unit]

**ASQ Responses:**
1. Wished you were dead (past few weeks): [Yes/No]
2. Family better off if you were dead (past few weeks): [Yes/No]
3. Thoughts of killing yourself (past week): [Yes/No]
4. Ever tried to kill yourself: [Yes/No]
   - If yes, when: [Date/timeframe]

**If any yes - Acuity Question:**
5. Thoughts of killing yourself right now: [Yes/No]

**Result:** [Negative screen / Positive screen]

**If Positive:**
- Follow-up assessment: [C-SSRS / Clinical interview - see separate note]
- Risk level determined: [Low/Moderate/High/Imminent]
- Safety interventions: [List]
- Disposition: [Plan]

**If Negative:**
- Crisis resources provided: [Yes - 988, Crisis Text Line, etc.]
- Plan: [Proceed with medical care, reassess as needed]
```

## Special Considerations

### Age Adaptations

**Children (10-12):**
- Use simple, concrete language
- "Killing yourself" may need explanation
- Involve caregivers after assessment

**Adolescents (13-17):**
- Ask directly - don't soften language
- Private assessment when possible
- Involve parents/guardians after screening if positive

**Adults:**
- Standard administration
- May resist disclosure due to stigma
- Emphasize confidentiality and care

**Older Adults:**
- Don't avoid asking due to age
- Often higher lethality if attempt made
- May be isolated, ask about support

### Medical Settings

**Emergency Department:**
- Screen all patients (recommended universal screening)
- High-risk population
- Positive screen common

**Inpatient Medical/Surgical:**
- Screen on admission or when concern arises
- Medical illness increases risk
- Coordinate with psychiatry if positive

**Primary Care:**
- Can be part of annual screening
- Positive screen → refer for mental health evaluation
- Low threshold for specialty referral

### Language and Cultural Considerations

**Non-English speakers:**
- Use validated translations when available
- Professional interpreter required
- Family members should not interpret suicide screening

**Cultural sensitivity:**
- Direct questions are appropriate across cultures
- Suicide stigma varies by culture
- May need to explain purpose of screening
- Respect cultural beliefs while prioritizing safety

## Integration with PHQ-9

**PHQ-9 Item 9 is NOT the same as ASQ:**
- PHQ-9 Item 9 asks about "past 2 weeks"
- PHQ-9 Item 9 includes "thoughts of hurting yourself" (may be non-suicidal)
- ASQ specifically asks about "killing yourself" (suicide-specific)

**If both available:**
- Positive PHQ-9 Item 9 → Can follow with ASQ or go directly to C-SSRS
- ASQ preferred for quick triage in medical settings
- C-SSRS provides most detailed assessment

## When to Use ASQ vs. C-SSRS

See [references/screening-comparison.md](../references/screening-comparison.md)

**Use ASQ when:**
- Very brief screening needed (20 seconds)
- Universal screening in busy medical settings
- Initial triage

**Use C-SSRS when:**
- Comprehensive assessment needed
- Time permits (5-15 minutes)
- Following positive ASQ
- Monitoring known suicide risk

**Key principle:** ASQ screens, C-SSRS assesses

## Limitations

**ASQ is a screener, not a comprehensive assessment:**
- Cannot determine risk level alone
- Cannot predict suicide
- Patient may not disclose
- Positive screen requires further evaluation
- False negatives possible (not all at risk will screen positive)

**Clinical judgment essential:**
- Screen negative but clinical concern → Assess anyway
- Risk can change rapidly
- Context matters

## Training

**Minimal training needed for ASQ:**
- Very brief, simple questions
- Training materials available from NIMH
- Practice recommended

**More training needed for:**
- Comprehensive assessment (C-SSRS)
- Risk level determination
- Safety planning
- Crisis intervention

## Crisis Resources

**Always have available to provide:**
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (call or text 988)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
- **Veterans Crisis Line:** Call 988 then press 1
- **Trevor Project** (LGBTQ+ youth): 1-866-488-7386
- **Emergency:** 911

**Give to all patients, even negative screen**

## Implementation Tips

**Effective screening:**
- Ask in private, calm setting when possible
- Use empathetic, non-judgmental tone
- Ask questions exactly as written
- Don't skip questions or modify wording
- Don't rationalize "no" responses ("You don't really mean that, right?")

**After screening:**
- If negative: Acknowledge, provide resources, continue care
- If positive: Stay calm, ensure safety, follow protocol, don't over-react or under-react
