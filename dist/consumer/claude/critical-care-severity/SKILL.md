# Critical Care Severity Tools

## Description

This skill provides structured guidance for common critical care severity and neurologic assessment tools. It supports accurate input collection, calculation, interpretation, and safety caveats.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) | Level of consciousness assessment |
| SOFA | Organ dysfunction severity |
| qSOFA | Sepsis risk screening outside ICU |
| MELD | Liver disease severity / transplant prioritization |
| NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) | Neurologic deficit severity in stroke |
| APACHE IV | ICU severity and mortality prediction (complex) |

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

1. Confirm clinical context and intended tool.
2. Collect required inputs with units and timing.
3. Validate inclusion and exclusion criteria.
4. Apply tool and present results with interpretation.
5. Provide safety caveats and next-step guidance.

## Tools

- [Glasgow Coma Scale](assets/gcs.md)
- [SOFA Score](assets/sofa.md)
- [qSOFA](assets/qsofa.md)
- [MELD Score](assets/meld.md)
- [NIH Stroke Scale](assets/nihss.md)
- [APACHE IV](assets/apache-iv.md)

## Safety and Limitations

- Support tools only; not diagnostic or prescriptive.
- Use local policies and clinical judgment.
- Many tools are validated for specific settings only.
