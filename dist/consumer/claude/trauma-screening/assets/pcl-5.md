## Items

Below is a list of problems that people sometimes have in response to a very stressful experience. Please read each problem carefully and then select one of the options to indicate how much you have been bothered by that problem **in the past month**.

**Response Scale:**
0 = Not at all

### Cluster B: Intrusion Symptoms (Items 1-5)
1. Repeated, disturbing, and unwanted memories of the stressful experience?
2. Repeated, disturbing dreams of the stressful experience?
3. Suddenly feeling or acting as if the stressful experience were actually happening again (as if you were actually back there reliving it)?

### Cluster C: Avoidance Symptoms (Items 6-7)
6. Avoiding memories, thoughts, or feelings related to the stressful experience?
7. Avoiding external reminders of the stressful experience (for example, people, places, conversations, activities, objects, or situations)?

### Cluster D: Negative Alterations in Cognitions and Mood (Items 8-14)
8. Trouble remembering important parts of the stressful experience?
9. Having strong negative beliefs about yourself, other people, or the world (for example, having thoughts such as: I am bad, there is something seriously wrong with me, no one can be trusted, the world is completely dangerous)?
10. Blaming yourself or someone else for the stressful experience or what happened after it?
11. Having strong negative feelings such as fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame?

18. Feeling jumpy or easily startled?
19. Having difficulty concentrating?
20. Trouble falling or staying asleep?

## Scoring

**Algorithm:**
1. Sum responses to all 20 items
2. Total score range: 0-80
3. Higher scores indicate greater PTSD symptom severity

**Interpretation:**

### Total Severity Score
- 0-30: Subclinical/mild symptoms
- 31-44: Moderate PTSD symptoms
- 45-59: Severe PTSD symptoms
- ≥60: Extreme PTSD symptoms

For detailed clinical interpretation and treatment recommendations, see [references/severity-levels.md](../references/severity-levels.md) and [references/clinical-decision-trees.md](../references/clinical-decision-trees.md)

### DSM-5 Diagnostic Threshold (Provisional)
**Criteria for probable PTSD diagnosis:**
1. At least 1 Cluster B item rated ≥2 (Moderately or higher)
2. At least 1 Cluster C item rated ≥2
3. At least 2 Cluster D items rated ≥2
4. At least 2 Cluster E items rated ≥2

**Clinical Cutoff:**
- Total score ≥33: Suggests probable PTSD (Bovin et al., 2016)
- Recommended for screening purposes; clinical interview required for diagnosis

### Symptom Cluster Scores
Track individual cluster severity for treatment planning:
- **Cluster B (Intrusion):** Items 1-5 (range 0-20)
- **Cluster C (Avoidance):** Items 6-7 (range 0-8)
- **Cluster D (Negative cognitions/mood):** Items 8-14 (range 0-28)
- **Cluster E (Arousal/reactivity):** Items 15-20 (range 0-24)

**Clinical Significance:**
- 10-20 point change: Clinically significant improvement
- 5-10 point change: Reliable improvement
- < 5 point change: Minimal/no change
