# Anxiety Severity Levels

This reference provides detailed interpretation of anxiety severity across GAD-7 and GAD-2 screening tools.

## GAD-7 Severity Levels

### Minimal Anxiety (0-4)
**Clinical Meaning:** No or minimal anxiety symptoms. Within normal range.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Rare or absent anxiety symptoms
- Minimal functional impairment
- No treatment typically indicated

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor during routine care
- Provide psychoeducation about anxiety
- Reassess if symptoms change

### Mild Anxiety (5-9)
**Clinical Meaning:** Mild anxiety symptoms with minimal functional impairment.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Some anxiety symptoms present
- Mild impact on daily functioning
- Patient often continues normal activities with effort
- May have periods of worry but generally manageable

**Recommended Actions:**
- Watchful waiting with close follow-up
- Relaxation techniques and stress management
- Psychoeducation about anxiety and coping strategies
- Consider brief counseling or support
- Reassess in 2-4 weeks

### Moderate Anxiety (10-14)
**Clinical Meaning:** Moderate anxiety symptoms with noticeable functional impairment. Meets threshold for generalized anxiety disorder (89% sensitivity, 82% specificity at cutoff of 10).

**Typical Presentation:**
- Clear anxiety symptoms
- Functional impairment in work, social, or personal domains
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Physical symptoms (tension, restlessness)
- Patient struggles with daily activities

**Recommended Actions:**
- Active treatment plan required
- Consider psychotherapy (CBT, exposure therapy) and/or medication
- Regular monitoring (every 2-4 weeks)
- Assess impact on functioning and quality of life
- Rule out other anxiety disorders (panic, social anxiety, specific phobias)

### Severe Anxiety (15-21)
**Clinical Meaning:** Severe anxiety with marked functional impairment. High symptom burden.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Severe, pervasive anxiety symptoms
- Significant impairment in multiple life domains
- Constant worry difficult to control
- Marked physical symptoms
- May have panic attacks or avoidance behaviors
- Sleep disturbance common

**Recommended Actions:**
- Active treatment strongly recommended
- Combination therapy (medication + psychotherapy) often indicated
- Close monitoring (weekly or biweekly)
- Specialty mental health referral
- Assess for co-occurring conditions (depression, substance use)
- Consider higher level of care (IOP) if:
  - Severe functional impairment
  - Co-occurring severe depression
  - Inadequate outpatient response

## GAD-2 Interpretation

### Negative Screen (0-2)
**Meaning:** Low probability of anxiety disorder.

**Actions:**
- Routine monitoring during regular care
- Reassess if clinical presentation changes
- No GAD-7 needed unless clinical concern

### Positive Screen (≥3)
**Meaning:** Elevated anxiety symptoms warrant further assessment.

**Actions:**
- Administer full GAD-7
- Do not diagnose based on GAD-2 alone
- GAD-2 is a screener, not diagnostic tool

## Treatment Response Monitoring

### Minimal Response (< 5-point decrease)
- Reassess treatment plan
- Consider treatment intensification or change
- Rule out barriers to treatment adherence
- Assess for co-occurring conditions

### Partial Response (5-9 point decrease but score still ≥10)
- Continue current treatment
- Monitor progress closely
- Consider augmentation if plateaued
- May need longer trial of current treatment

### Good Response (≥5-point decrease AND score <10)
- Significant improvement
- Continue current treatment
- Plan for maintenance and relapse prevention
- Gradually reduce monitoring frequency

## Differential Diagnosis Considerations

### GAD-7 Screens for Anxiety, Not Specific Disorder

**High GAD-7 may indicate:**
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (most common)
- Panic Disorder
- Social Anxiety Disorder
- Specific Phobias
- PTSD (anxiety component)
- Depression with anxious features
- Medical conditions causing anxiety

**Further assessment needed to determine:**
- Specific anxiety disorder diagnosis
- Triggers and patterns
- Co-occurring conditions
- Treatment approach

## Special Considerations

### Physical Health Conditions

**Medical conditions that may elevate GAD-7:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Respiratory conditions (asthma, COPD)
- Chronic pain
- Caffeine or substance use

**Approach:**
- Rule out medical causes
- Treat medical conditions concurrently
- Still treat anxiety even if medical component present

### Cultural Factors
- Expression of anxiety varies across cultures
- Somatic symptoms may be more prominent in some populations
- Use culturally validated versions when available
- Consider cultural context of worry themes

### Age Considerations
- **Adolescents:** GAD-7 validated in teens
- **Older adults:** GAD-7 validated, account for medical comorbidity
- **Children <12:** Different screening tools recommended (SCARED, etc.)

### Co-occurring Depression
- Anxiety and depression commonly co-occur
- Consider administering both GAD-7 and PHQ-9
- Integrated treatment often needed
- Treat both conditions concurrently

### Substance Use
- Substance use/withdrawal can mimic anxiety
- Caffeine, stimulants increase anxiety symptoms
- Assess substance use in context
- May need substance use treatment

## Item-Level Analysis

### Items 1-3: Core Worry Symptoms
High scores on items 1, 2, 3 indicate core generalized anxiety features (nervousness, uncontrollable worry, excessive worry)

### Items 4-5: Somatic/Motor Tension
High scores on items 4, 5 indicate physical manifestations (trouble relaxing, restlessness)

### Items 6-7: Cognitive/Emotional Features
High scores on items 6, 7 may suggest:
- Item 6 (irritability): Common in anxiety, also seen in depression
- Item 7 (fear): May indicate panic features or specific fears

## When GAD-7 Alone Is Insufficient

**Additional assessment needed when:**
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 ≥15)
- Specific phobias suspected
- Panic attacks present
- Social anxiety prominent
- PTSD suspected
- Suicidal ideation (screen with PHQ-9 Item 9)
- Substance use concerns
