# McIsaac Score (Modified Centor)

## Purpose
Estimate GAS pharyngitis likelihood using Centor criteria plus age adjustment.

## Intended Population
Children and adults with sore throat.

## Inputs
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tonsillar exudates or swelling | 1 | - |
| Tender anterior cervical adenopathy | 1 | - |
| Fever (history or measured) | 1 | - |
| Absence of cough | 1 | - |
| Age 3 to 14 years | +1 | - |
| Age 15 to 44 years | 0 | - |
| Age >=45 years | -1 | - |

## Algorithm
Sum points across criteria. Score range: -1 to 5.

## Output
McIsaac total score.

## Interpretation
Use local guidelines for testing and treatment decisions. Many guidelines recommend testing rather than empiric antibiotics at moderate scores.

## Limitations
- Requires clinical judgment and local epidemiology.

## Example
Age 12, fever, tonsillar swelling, no cough, tender nodes:
- Score = 1 (age) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
