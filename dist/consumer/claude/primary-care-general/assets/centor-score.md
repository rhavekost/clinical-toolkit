# Centor Score (Original)

## Purpose
Estimate likelihood of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in adults.

## Intended Population
Adults with sore throat. Use McIsaac for age-adjusted scoring in broader populations.

## Inputs
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tonsillar exudates | 1 | - |
| Tender anterior cervical adenopathy | 1 | - |
| Fever (history or measured) | 1 | - |
| Absence of cough | 1 | - |

## Algorithm
Sum points across criteria. Score range: 0 to 4.

## Output
Centor total score.

## Interpretation
Use local guidelines for testing and treatment decisions. Centor is primarily validated in adults.

## Limitations
- Not validated in pediatric populations.
- Clinical judgment required for management decisions.

## Example
Fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, no tender nodes:
- Score = 3
