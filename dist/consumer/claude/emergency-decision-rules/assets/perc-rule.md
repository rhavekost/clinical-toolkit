# PERC Rule

## Purpose
Exclude pulmonary embolism in low-risk patients without D-dimer testing.

## Intended Population
Adults with **low pretest probability** for PE by clinician gestalt or a validated score.

## Inputs (All must be negative)
| Criterion | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Age <50 years | Yes | - |
| Heart rate <100 bpm | Yes | - |
| Oxygen saturation >=95% on room air | Yes | - |
| No hemoptysis | Yes | - |
| No estrogen use | Yes | Includes OCP or hormone therapy |
| No prior DVT or PE | Yes | - |
| No unilateral leg swelling | Yes | - |
| No recent surgery or trauma requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks | Yes | - |

## Algorithm
If **all** criteria are met in a low-risk patient, PE can be ruled out without D-dimer.

## Output
PERC negative: yes/no.

## Interpretation
If any criterion is positive, PERC is not met and further testing is indicated per local protocols.

## Limitations
- Only validated in low pretest probability patients.
- Not intended for high-risk, pregnant, or hospitalized patients.

## Example
Age 36, HR 88, SpO2 98%, no hemoptysis, no estrogen, no prior VTE, no unilateral leg swelling, no recent surgery:
- PERC negative.
