# Claude Consumer Bundles

Claude consumer apps require one skill per upload.
Each folder in this directory is a per-skill bundle ready to zip.

Suggested workflow:
1. Zip a single skill folder (folder contents at zip root).
2. Upload the zip in Claude Settings -> Capabilities -> Skills.

Tip: use `npm run package:claudeai` to generate per-skill zip files.
