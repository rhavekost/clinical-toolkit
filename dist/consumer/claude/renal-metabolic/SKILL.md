# Renal and Metabolic Calculators

## Description

This skill provides structured calculation guidance for common renal and metabolic formulas used in clinical practice. It supports accurate input collection, calculation, interpretation, and safety caveats.

## Quick Reference

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| CKD-EPI 2021 (Creatinine) | Estimate eGFR without race variable |
| CKD-EPI 2021 (Cystatin C) | eGFR using cystatin C or combined equation |
| Cockcroft-Gault (CrCl) | Drug dosing using creatinine clearance |
| Corrected Calcium | Adjust calcium for albumin |
| Corrected Sodium | Adjust sodium in hyperglycemia |
| Anion Gap | Metabolic acidosis assessment |
| Winters Formula | Expected pCO2 in metabolic acidosis |
| A-a Gradient | Oxygenation and V/Q evaluation |
| Friedewald LDL | Estimate LDL-C from standard lipids |
| BMI | Body mass index classification |

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

1. Confirm the clinical context and intended tool.
2. Collect required inputs with units and timing.
3. Validate inputs and resolve missing data.
4. Calculate and present results with interpretation.
5. Provide safety caveats and limitations.

## Safety and Limitations

- Support tool only; not diagnostic or prescriptive.
- Use local policies and clinical judgment.
- Many formulas have population limits and invalid ranges.
