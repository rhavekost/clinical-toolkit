# Suicide Risk Levels

Categorization of suicide risk levels: low, moderate, high, and imminent.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**Risk levels guide clinical decision-making but do NOT replace clinical judgment. When uncertain, err on the side of caution and seek consultation.**

**Complete crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Risk Level Framework

Risk determination integrates multiple factors:
- **Ideation:** Presence, frequency, intensity, duration
- **Plan/Intent:** Specific method, access to means, intent to act
- **Behavior:** Previous attempts, recent preparatory acts
- **Protective factors:** Reasons for living, support, coping skills
- **Risk factors:** Mental illness, substance use, losses, isolation
- **Clinical presentation:** Agitation, hopelessness, impulsivity

## Low Risk

### Definition
Minimal current suicide risk with adequate protective factors and no immediate plan or intent.

### Typical Presentation

**Ideation:**
- Passive thoughts of death ("I wish I weren't here")
- No active thoughts of suicide
- OR fleeting suicidal thoughts without plan or intent
- Can easily control thoughts
- Strong deterrents present

**Behavior:**
- No recent suicide attempts
- No preparatory acts
- No access to means or has not considered means

**Protective Factors (strong):**
- Reasons for living (children, family, pets, religious beliefs)
- Good support system
- Engaged in treatment
- Future-oriented
- Good coping skills

**Risk Factors (minimal/manageable):**
- Mild depression or anxiety
- Stressors present but manageable
- Adequate functioning

### Clinical Actions

**Immediate:**
- Develop safety plan (see [safety-planning.md](safety-planning.md))
- Provide crisis resources (988, Crisis Text Line)
- Assess protective factors and reinforce
- Brief mental health intervention or psychoeducation

**Follow-up:**
- Schedule within 1 week (sooner if possible)
- Phone check-in within 24-48 hours (optional but recommended)
- Referral for outpatient mental health treatment if not engaged

**Means Restriction:**
- Discuss firearm safety if firearms in home
- Remove unnecessary medications
- Educate family if patient consents

**Documentation:**
- Risk level and rationale
- Protective and risk factors
- Safety plan
- Crisis resources provided
- Follow-up plan

### When Low Risk May Escalate

**Monitor for:**
- Increasing ideation frequency/intensity
- Development of plan or intent
- Loss of protective factors
- Worsening mental health symptoms
- Substance use increase
- New losses or stressors

## Moderate Risk

### Definition
Elevated suicide risk requiring close monitoring and intervention, but immediate danger not assessed as high if safety plan in place.

### Typical Presentation

**Ideation:**
- Active suicidal thoughts
- Some consideration of method
- Limited or uncertain intent
- Thoughts more frequent but still controllable
- Mixed deterrents (some present, some absent)

**Behavior:**
- Past suicide attempt (not recent)
- Possible vague preparatory thoughts
- Increased focus on suicide
- May be researching methods

**Protective Factors (mixed):**
- Some reasons for living but ambivalent
- Support system present but may not be engaged
- Willing to engage in safety planning

**Risk Factors (significant):**
- Moderate depression or anxiety
- Some substance use
- Recent losses or stressors
- History of trauma or abuse
- Impulsivity present

### Clinical Actions

**Immediate:**
- Comprehensive safety plan with means restriction
- Same-day or next-day mental health evaluation
- Increase monitoring (daily check-ins if outpatient)
- Involve support system (with consent)
- Remove lethal means (firearms, excess medications)
- Consider increasing level of care (more frequent therapy, IOP)

**Follow-up:**
- Contact within 24 hours
- Appointment within 1-3 days
- Weekly contact minimum until risk decreases

**Consultation:**
- Consult with supervisor or psychiatry
- Discuss need for higher level of care

**Disposition:**
- Outpatient with intensive monitoring
- OR Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)
- Hospitalization if safety cannot be ensured

**Documentation:**
- Detailed risk assessment
- Why moderate vs. high/low
- Consultation obtained
- Safety plan specifics
- Means restriction steps taken
- Detailed follow-up plan

### When Moderate Risk Escalates

**Requires escalation to high risk if:**
- Development of specific plan with intent
- Loss of protective factors
- Preparatory behaviors begin
- Patient states cannot keep self safe
- Increased substance use
- Access to lethal means

## High Risk

### Definition
Serious, imminent suicide risk requiring immediate intensive intervention and likely psychiatric hospitalization or continuous observation.

### Typical Presentation

**Ideation:**
- Active suicidal ideation with specific plan
- Intent to act (now or in near future)
- Frequent, persistent thoughts
- Difficult or unable to control thoughts
- Deterrents weak or absent

**Behavior:**
- Recent suicide attempt (within weeks/months)
- Current preparatory behavior (collecting pills, obtaining weapon, writing note)
- Saying goodbye to loved ones
- Giving away possessions
- Researching suicide methods

**Protective Factors (weak/absent):**
- Minimal or no reasons for living
- Disconnected from support
- Feels hopeless about future
- Poor coping, overwhelmed

**Risk Factors (severe):**
- Severe depression, psychosis, agitation
- Active substance use/intoxication
- Recent significant loss
- Isolation
- Access to lethal means
- Previous high-lethality attempts

### Clinical Actions

**Immediate (Do NOT delay):**
- **Do not leave patient alone**
- Emergency psychiatric evaluation
- Call 988 or crisis team for consultation
- Remove all means of self-harm
- Continuous observation
- Notify emergency contact/family
- Consider calling 911 if patient uncooperative or means to flee

**Disposition:**
- Psychiatric hospitalization (voluntary or involuntary)
- OR crisis stabilization unit with 24-hour monitoring
- Discharge NOT recommended unless extraordinary circumstances with intensive safety plan

**If Outpatient Discharge (RARE and requires extensive justification):**
- Multiple protective factors emerge
- Patient contracts for safety with credible plan
- 24-hour monitoring by family
- Daily mental health contact
- Immediate means restriction verified
- Next-day psychiatric appointment confirmed
- Consultation obtained and documented

**Documentation:**
- Extensive risk assessment
- Justification for risk level
- All protective and risk factors
- Consultation obtained
- If discharged: Detailed explanation of why hospitalization not pursued
- Safety plan and who will monitor
- Clear follow-up within 24 hours

### When to Escalate to Imminent

**Move to imminent risk if:**
- Patient actively attempting suicide
- States will attempt today/tonight
- Has means in hand
- Cannot contract for safety
- Psychotic with command hallucinations to self-harm

## Imminent Risk

### Definition
Patient is in immediate danger of suicide attempt. Emergency intervention required NOW.

### Typical Presentation

**Ideation/Intent:**
- Current, active suicidal ideation
- Specific plan with immediate intent
- States will act imminently (today, tonight, when alone)
- Cannot or will not commit to safety

**Behavior:**
- Attempt in progress or just occurred
- Has means in hand (pills, weapon, etc.)
- Actively preparing (on bridge, in car with hose, pills in hand)
- Command hallucinations to harm self

**Mental State:**
- Severe agitation or psychosis
- Extreme hopelessness
- Intoxicated with disinhibition
- Feeling "no way out"
- May be calm (resolved to act)

**Protective Factors:**
- None or completely overridden by desperation

### Clinical Actions

**IMMEDIATE Emergency Response:**

1. **Call 911 immediately**
   - Suicide attempt in progress
   - Patient states immediate intent and has means
   - Patient violent or uncontrollable

2. **Do NOT leave patient alone for any reason**
   - One-to-one observation
   - Remove all potential means
   - Safe environment

3. **Emergency services evaluation**
   - Emergency department
   - Mobile crisis team
   - Police if necessary for safety

4. **Medical stabilization if attempt occurred**
   - Treat overdose, injuries
   - Medical clearance before psychiatric care

**Disposition:**
- Psychiatric hospitalization (involuntary if necessary)
- No outpatient discharge
- Continuous observation until admitted

**Family Notification:**
- Notify emergency contact (HIPAA allows for emergency)
- Involve in safety planning if appropriate

**Documentation:**
- Real-time documentation
- Exact statements (verbatim)
- All actions taken, timeline
- Who was notified, when
- Consultation obtained
- Disposition and accepting facility

### After Immediate Crisis

**Once stabilized in hospital:**
- Intensive psychiatric care
- Medication evaluation
- Psychotherapy
- Milieu therapy
- Discharge planning with intensive outpatient follow-up

## Special Situations

### Patient Refuses Help (High/Imminent Risk)

**If patient is danger to self and refuses voluntary treatment:**
- Involuntary psychiatric hold/evaluation
- Know your state laws (typically 72-hour hold)
- Police may be needed to transport
- Document extensively
- Patient autonomy yields to safety in emergency

### Risk Fluctuates

**Suicide risk is NOT static:**
- Can change hour to hour
- Substance use increases risk acutely
- Losses, conflicts trigger escalation
- Reassess frequently
- Patient may minimize to avoid hospitalization

### Chronic Suicidality

**Some patients have persistent ideation:**
- Personality disorders (especially borderline)
- Chronic PTSD
- Treatment-resistant depression

**Approach:**
- Assess for acute changes in chronic baseline
- Safety planning essential
- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) often helpful
- Means restriction still critical
- Hospitalize for acute escalations

## Risk Assessment Challenges

### Patient Denies to Avoid Hospitalization

**Common phenomenon:**
- Initially endorses ideation
- Then denies when realizes hospitalization possible
- "I didn't really mean it"

**Clinical approach:**
- Take initial disclosure seriously
- Explore discrepancy without judgment
- Assess behavior, not just words
- Consult when uncertain
- Document both disclosure and retraction

### Assessing Risk in Context

**Consider:**
- Cultural factors in expressing distress
- Psychotic patients may lack insight
- Intoxicated patients may have impaired judgment
- Adolescents may be impulsive
- Chronic pain patients may express wish to die from suffering

**Key:** Always assess, never dismiss

## Protective Factors

**Presence of protective factors reduces risk:**
- Reasons for living (children, pets, responsibilities)
- Religious/spiritual beliefs against suicide
- Fear of death or pain
- Access to effective mental health care
- Positive therapeutic relationship
- Problem-solving skills
- Social support
- Future-oriented plans (upcoming events)

**Absence does NOT mean imminent risk, but concerning**

## Risk Factors

**Presence of risk factors increases risk:**
- Previous suicide attempts (strongest predictor)
- Mental health diagnosis (depression, bipolar, psychosis, PTSD)
- Substance use disorder
- Recent discharge from psychiatric hospitalization
- Access to lethal means (firearms especially)
- Recent loss (relationship, job, status, health)
- Chronic pain or terminal illness
- Childhood trauma or abuse
- Family history of suicide
- Social isolation
- Impulsivity
- Male sex (higher lethality)
- LGBTQ+ identity (higher risk due to minority stress)
- Recent exposure to suicide (contagion)

## Summary Table

| Risk Level | Ideation | Plan/Intent | Behavior | Protective Factors | Disposition |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Passive or none | None | None recent | Strong | Outpatient, 1-week follow-up |
| **Moderate** | Active, vague plan | Uncertain intent | Past attempt (not recent) | Mixed | Intensive outpatient or IOP, 1-3 day follow-up |
| **High** | Active, specific plan | Intent present | Recent attempt or preparatory | Weak | Psychiatric hospitalization likely |
| **Imminent** | Active, immediate | Immediate intent, has means | Attempt in progress or imminent | None/overridden | Emergency hospitalization |

## Clinical Judgment Essential

**Remember:**
- Risk levels are guidelines, not rules
- Clinical judgment trumps scoring
- When in doubt, consult
- When still in doubt after consult, err on side of safety
- Cannot predict with certainty - aim to prevent
