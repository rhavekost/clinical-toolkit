# Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

## Overview
- **Type:** Comprehensive suicide risk assessment
- **Time:** 5-15 minutes (varies by responses)
- **Purpose:** Assess suicide ideation severity, behavior, and risk level
- **Population:** Ages 12+, validated across diverse settings
- **Use:** Clinical assessment, research, screening in healthcare settings

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**This assessment screens for suicidal ideation and behavior. ANY positive response requires immediate clinical follow-up and safety assessment.**

**Universal crisis protocols:** See [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md) and [../references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](../references/risk-assessment-protocol.md)

## Assessment Sections

The C-SSRS has multiple modules. The **screening version** (used most commonly) includes:

### Section 1: Suicidal Ideation

**Ask about the past month (or since last assessment):**

1. **Wish to be Dead**
   - "Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?"
   - *Passive thoughts about death without active intent*

2. **Suicidal Thoughts**
   - "Have you actually had thoughts of killing yourself?"
   - *Active thoughts about ending one's life*

3. **Suicidal Thoughts with Method**
   - "Have you thought about how you might do this?"
   - *Thoughts with some consideration of method*

4. **Suicidal Intent**
   - "Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?"
   - *Intent to act, not just thoughts*

5. **Suicidal Intent with Plan**
   - "Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan?"
   - *Specific plan with intent to act*

**If YES to any ideation questions → Continue to Section 2 (Intensity)**

### Section 2: Intensity of Ideation

**Assess the most severe ideation in past month:**

- **Frequency:** How often? (Less than once a week, once a week, 2-5 times, daily or almost daily, many times each day)
- **Duration:** How long do thoughts last? (Fleeting, less than 1 hour, 1-4 hours, 4-8 hours, more than 8 hours, persistent/continuous)
- **Controllability:** Can you stop thinking about it? (Easily able to control, can control with little difficulty, can control with some difficulty, can control with a lot of difficulty, unable to control)
- **Deterrents:** What stops you? (Deterrents definitely stop you, probably stop you, uncertain, probably don't stop you, definitely don't stop you)
- **Reasons for ideation:** Why are you having these thoughts?

### Section 3: Suicidal Behavior

**Lifetime and past 3 months:**

1. **Actual Attempt**
   - "Have you made a suicide attempt?"
   - *Potentially self-injurious act with any intent to die*
   - If yes: When? How? What happened?

2. **Interrupted Attempt**
   - "Has someone or something stopped you from attempting suicide when you were about to do it?"
   - If yes: Details?

3. **Aborted Attempt**
   - "Have you started to do something to try to kill yourself but stopped before actually doing anything?"
   - If yes: Details?

4. **Preparatory Acts or Behavior**
   - "Have you done anything to prepare to kill yourself (collected pills, obtained gun, wrote note, etc.)?"
   - If yes: What? When?

5. **Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (for context)**
   - "Have you done anything to hurt yourself without the intention of killing yourself?"
   - *Important to distinguish from suicide attempts*

## Scoring and Risk Categorization

### Suicidal Ideation Severity

**Score based on highest level endorsed:**

0. **No ideation**
1. **Wish to be dead** (passive)
2. **Non-specific active suicidal thoughts**
3. **Active suicidal ideation with methods** (no plan or intent)
4. **Active suicidal ideation with some intent** (no plan)
5. **Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent**

### Risk Level Determination

**Combines ideation severity, intensity, and behavior:**

See [references/risk-levels.md](../references/risk-levels.md) for detailed risk categorization

**General guidelines:**

- **Low Risk:** Level 1-2 ideation, no plan/intent, strong deterrents, no recent behavior
- **Moderate Risk:** Level 3 ideation, or level 1-2 with concerning intensity
- **High Risk:** Level 4-5 ideation, or recent preparatory behavior
- **Imminent Risk:** Level 5 with plan and intent, recent attempt, or current preparatory behavior

**Note:** Clinical judgment essential - risk level not determined by score alone

## Clinical Actions by Risk Level

See [references/risk-assessment-protocol.md](../references/risk-assessment-protocol.md) for complete protocol

**Immediate actions:**
- Low: Safety plan, close follow-up, crisis resources
- Moderate: Same-day evaluation, safety plan, remove means, frequent contact
- High: Immediate psychiatric evaluation, consider hospitalization
- Imminent: Emergency services, do not leave alone, likely hospitalization

## Special Considerations

### Age Adaptations

**Adolescents (12-17):**
- Use age-appropriate language
- Assess peer relationships, school stressors
- Involve parents/guardians (balance with teen privacy)
- Higher impulsivity - lower threshold for intervention

**Older Adults:**
- Ask directly (don't assume age protects)
- Assess medical illness burden, loss, isolation
- Higher lethality of attempts
- May underreport due to stigma

### Cultural Considerations

- Direct questions appropriate across cultures
- Expression of suicidal thoughts varies
- Religious/cultural views on suicide affect disclosure
- Use interpreters when needed
- Understand cultural context of protective factors

### Special Populations

**Psychosis:**
- Command hallucinations to harm self
- Assess reality testing
- Higher risk, may need hospitalization

**Substance Use:**
- Assess current intoxication
- Ask about suicidal thoughts when sober vs. intoxicated
- Substances increase impulsivity and risk

**Chronic Pain/Medical Illness:**
- Common in those with severe/chronic conditions
- "Life is not worth living with this pain" warrants full assessment
- Treat both condition and suicidal ideation

## Limitations

**C-SSRS is a tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment:**
- Cannot predict suicide with certainty
- Patient may not disclose
- Risk can change rapidly
- Use within broader assessment
- Requires clinical training to administer

## When to Use C-SSRS vs. Other Screening

See [references/screening-comparison.md](../references/screening-comparison.md)

**Use C-SSRS when:**
- Comprehensive assessment needed
- Time permits (5-15 minutes)
- Positive screen on brief tool (ASQ, PHQ-9 Item 9)
- Monitoring known suicide risk
- Clinical concern present

**Use brief screener (ASQ) when:**
- Very limited time
- Initial screening in medical settings
- Positive → follow with C-SSRS
