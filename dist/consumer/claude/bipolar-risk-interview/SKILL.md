# Bipolar Risk Interview (Non‑Validated)

## Description

This is an **original, non‑validated** interview guide for exploring bipolar risk factors. It is **not diagnostic** and should not be used as a screening instrument.

## Use Cases

- When clinical history suggests possible bipolar spectrum features
- When antidepressant response has been atypical or poor
- When family history suggests bipolar disorder

## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)

Use this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.

1. Confirm this is a non-validated interview guide and check readiness.
2. Ask one prompt at a time from the interview guide and wait for a response.
3. Summarize key points and confirm accuracy before moving on.
4. At the end, synthesize risk factors, red flags, and functional impact with suggested next steps.
5. If safety concerns arise, pause and follow appropriate safety protocols.
