## Limitations & Considerations

**Documentation serves multiple purposes:**
- Clinical communication and continuity
- Legal protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Quality improvement
- Reimbursement

**Balance competing demands:**
- Thoroughness vs. efficiency
- Detail vs. readability
- Compliance vs. clinical utility
- Privacy vs. necessary communication

**Legal Considerations:**
- Documentation can be subpoenaed
- Write assuming record could be read in court
- Follow "document defensibly" principle
- Know your jurisdiction's requirements
- Understand HIPAA and privacy regulations

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Avoid cultural assumptions
- Use patient's own language when quoting
- Note cultural factors affecting presentation
- Document cultural adaptations to treatment
- Recognize bias in interpretation

**Electronic Health Records:**
- Follow system-specific requirements
- Use templates thoughtfully (customize, don't just click)
- Maintain security/confidentiality
- Understand copy-forward risks
- Regular review of historical notes for accuracy
