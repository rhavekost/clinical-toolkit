# PTSD Clinical Decision Trees

This reference provides structured clinical decision-making guidance for PTSD screening, assessment, and treatment planning based on PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5 results.

## Decision Tree 1: Initial PTSD Screening

```
Patient presents with known trauma exposure
         |
         v
Administer PC-PTSD-5
         |
         +-- Score 0-2 (Negative Screen)
         |        |
         |        v
         |   PTSD unlikely
         |        |
         |        v
         |   - Monitor during routine care
         |   - Provide trauma psychoeducation
         |   - Reassess if symptoms emerge
         |   - Consider other diagnoses if distress present
         |
         +-- Score ≥3 (Positive Screen)
                  |
                  v

         |   - Prazosin for trauma nightmares
         |
         +-- High Cluster C (Avoidance) score?
         |        |
         |        v
         |   Prioritize:
         |   - Graduated exposure
         |   - Behavioral activation
         |   - Address avoidance early in treatment
         |   - May need motivational work before trauma focus
         |
         +-- High Cluster D (Negative cognitions/mood) score?
         |        |
         |        v

                  |
                  v
            Prioritize:
            - Anxiety management techniques
            - Relaxation training
            - Medication for physiological arousal
            - Sleep hygiene for insomnia
            - Anger management if needed
```

## Decision Tree 7: Comorbidity Assessment and Management

```
PTSD confirmed (PCL-5 ≥33 and criteria met)
         |
         v
Screen for common comorbidities
         |
         +-- Depression present? (Use PHQ-9 - see ../../depression-screening/)
         |        |
         |       YES --> Integrated treatment
         |        |      - Address both PTSD and depression
         |        |      - SSRIs beneficial for both
         |        |      - Trauma therapy may improve both
         |
         +-- Anxiety present? (Use GAD-7 - see ../../anxiety-screening/)
         |        |
         |       YES --> Integrated treatment
         |        |      - Trauma therapy addresses both
         |        |      - Consider medication if severe
         |
         +-- Substance use? (Use AUDIT-C/DAST-10 - see ../../substance-screening/)
                  |
                 YES --> Treatment sequence decision
                  |
                  v
            Assess severity and stability
                  |
                  +-- Active severe SUD → Stabilize substance use first
                  |                       Consider dual diagnosis program
                  |
                  +-- Mild-moderate SUD → Integrated treatment
                                         Address both concurrently
```

## Treatment Recommendations by Severity Level

### Subclinical/Mild Symptoms (PCL-5 0-30)

**Recommended Interventions:**
- Psychoeducation about trauma responses
- Normalization of symptoms
- Basic coping strategies:
  - Grounding techniques
  - Self-care strategies
  - Sleep hygiene
  - Social support
- Watchful waiting with follow-up in 4-6 weeks
- No active treatment typically indicated

**When to escalate:**
- Symptoms persist beyond 3 months
- Functional impairment develops
- Patient requests treatment
- Symptoms worsen

### Moderate PTSD (PCL-5 31-44)

**Recommended Interventions:**

**First-line: Evidence-based trauma-focused therapy**
- Prolonged Exposure (PE)
- Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)

**Alternative/Adjunct: Medication**
- SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine)
- SNRI (venlafaxine)
- Consider if therapy unavailable or patient preference
- Consider as adjunct to therapy if partial response

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess with PCL-5 every 4-8 weeks
- Monitor safety at each contact
- Track functional improvement

### Severe PTSD (PCL-5 45-59)

**Recommended Interventions:**

**Strongly recommend: Combination treatment**
- Evidence-based trauma therapy (PE, CPT, EMDR)
- PLUS medication (SSRI/SNRI)
- Close monitoring (weekly or biweekly)

**Specialty mental health referral**
- If not already in specialty care
- May need trauma specialist

**Address comorbidities**
- Comprehensive assessment for depression, anxiety, substance use
- Integrated treatment approach

**Consider higher level of care if:**
- Suicidal ideation
- Severe substance use
- Unable to function in outpatient setting
- Inadequate response to intensive outpatient care

### Extreme PTSD (PCL-5 ≥60)

**Recommended Interventions:**

**Immediate specialty mental health referral**

**Consider higher level of care:**
- Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)
- Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)
- Inpatient hospitalization if:
  - Imminent suicide risk
  - Severe self-harm
  - Psychotic symptoms
  - Unable to care for self

**Comprehensive treatment approach:**
- Evidence-based trauma therapy (when patient stable enough)
- Medication management (often multiple medications)
- Case management
- Family/support involvement
- Coordination with primary care

**Very close monitoring:**
- At least weekly contact
- Comprehensive safety assessment each contact
- Frequent symptom monitoring

## Referral Decision Points

### When to Refer to Specialty Mental Health

**Immediate referral (same day/week):**
- PCL-5 ≥60 (extreme symptoms)
- Active suicidal ideation
- Psychotic symptoms
- Severe functional impairment
- Complex trauma presentation

**Urgent referral (within 2 weeks):**
- PCL-5 45-59 (severe symptoms)
- Significant functional impairment
- Comorbid severe depression or substance use
- Patient request for specialty care
- Primary care provider uncomfortable managing

**Routine referral (within 1 month):**
- PCL-5 31-44 (moderate symptoms)
- Patient prefers specialty care
- Evidence-based trauma therapy not available in primary care
- Inadequate response to initial treatment

### When to Consider Higher Level of Care

**Inpatient psychiatric hospitalization:**
- Imminent suicide risk
- Severe self-harm behaviors
- Psychotic symptoms with poor reality testing
- Complete inability to care for self
- Failed lower levels of care with deterioration

**Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP):**
- Severe symptoms interfering with daily function
- Need for intensive treatment (6 hours/day, 5 days/week)
- Step-down from inpatient
- Prevention of hospitalization

**Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):**
- Moderate-severe symptoms
- Need for structured treatment (3 hours/day, 3-5 days/week)
- Inadequate response to weekly outpatient care
- Step-down from PHP

## Special Considerations

### Acute Trauma (< 1 month post-trauma)
- Symptoms may be acute stress reaction, not PTSD
- Provide support and psychoeducation
- Monitor symptoms
- Defer trauma-focused therapy unless requested
- Reassess at 1 month

### Complex Trauma/Developmental Trauma
- May need adapted treatment approaches
- Consider phase-based treatment:
  1. Safety and stabilization
  2. Trauma processing
  3. Integration and rehabilitation
- Refer to trauma specialist

### Military/Veteran Populations
- Consider combat-related trauma specifics
- May benefit from veteran-specific programs
- Address military culture considerations
- VA resources available

### Trauma with Ongoing Threat
- Address current safety first
- May defer trauma processing until safe
- Focus on safety planning and stabilization
- Coordinate with protective services if needed

| 31-44 | Moderate | Evidence-based trauma therapy OR medication |
| 45-59 | Severe | Combination therapy + medication, specialty referral |
| ≥60 | Extreme | Immediate specialty referral, consider higher level of care |

**Always assess safety regardless of score**
**Always use trauma-informed approach**
**Always consider patient preference and cultural factors**
