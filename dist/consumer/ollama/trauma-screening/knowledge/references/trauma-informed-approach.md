# Trauma-Informed Approach to PTSD Screening

This reference provides guidance on trauma-informed principles and techniques for conducting PTSD screening and assessment in a way that prioritizes safety, empowerment, and minimizes re-traumatization.

## Core Principles of Trauma-Informed Care

### 1. Safety
**Physical and Psychological Safety**
- Create safe, welcoming environment
- Explain procedures before beginning
- Ensure privacy and confidentiality
- Allow patient control over pacing
- Have crisis resources readily available

### 2. Trustworthiness and Transparency
**Clear Communication**
- Explain purpose of screening
- Describe how information will be used
- Be honest about mandatory reporting limits
- Share results and interpretations with patient

### 3. Peer Support and Mutual Self-Help
**Collaborative Approach**
- Position patient as expert on their experience
- Validate trauma responses as normal reactions
- Normalize help-seeking
- Connect to support resources

### 4. Collaboration and Mutuality
**Shared Decision-Making**
- Include patient in assessment process
- Discuss treatment options collaboratively
- Respect patient preferences
- Power-sharing vs. hierarchical approach

### 5. Empowerment, Voice, and Choice
**Patient Autonomy**
- Patient chooses when/how to disclose
- Option to skip questions
- Control over pace of assessment
- Self-determination in treatment planning

### 6. Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues
**Cultural Humility**
- Recognize cultural context of trauma
- Understand historical trauma (e.g., racism, colonization)
- Address gender-specific trauma issues
- Use culturally adapted assessments when available

## Pre-Screening Preparation

### Setting the Stage

**Environment:**
- Private, quiet space
- Comfortable seating arrangement
- Tissues available
- Easy exit access
- Remove potential triggers (weapons, sharp objects if relevant)

**Clinician Preparation:**
- Review trauma-informed principles
- Prepare grounding techniques
- Have crisis resources ready
- Clear schedule to avoid rushing
- Manage own trauma reactions (vicarious trauma)

### Introducing the Screening

**Sample Introduction Script:**

*"I'm going to ask you some questions about difficult experiences and how they might be affecting you. These questions are about trauma and PTSD symptoms. Some people find these questions bring up difficult feelings or memories.*

*You're in control - you can skip questions, take breaks, or stop at any time. We can go at whatever pace feels right for you. There are no right or wrong answers. This helps me understand what you're experiencing so we can figure out the best way to help.*

*Do you have any questions before we begin? Are you comfortable proceeding?"*

**Key Elements:**
- Warn about potentially distressing content
- Emphasize patient control
- Normalize reactions
- Invite questions
- Obtain explicit consent to proceed

## During Screening: Trauma-Informed Techniques

### Universal Precautions Approach
**Assume potential trauma history in all patients**
- Use trauma-informed language with everyone
- Don't assume who has/hasn't experienced trauma
- Create safe environment for all
- Avoid retraumatizing questions or approaches

### Pacing and Control

**Patient Controls Pace:**
- "We can slow down or take a break anytime."
- "Would you like to pause before continuing?"
- Watch for signs of distress
- Offer breaks proactively

**Grounding During Screening:**
If patient becomes distressed:
- Pause assessment
- Offer grounding: "Can you feel your feet on the floor?"
- Orient to present: "You're safe here with me right now."
- Allow time to regulate before continuing
- Patient decides if/when to continue

### Validating and Normalizing

**Validate Responses:**
- "That makes sense given what you've been through."
- "Those are common reactions to trauma."
- "Thank you for sharing that with me."

**Normalize PTSD Symptoms:**
- Frame symptoms as normal trauma responses, not pathology
- "Your brain is trying to protect you."
- "These reactions show your mind is processing a difficult experience."

### Language Considerations

**Use Trauma-Informed Language:**

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "What's wrong with you?" | "What happened to you?" |
| "Crazy" or "insane" | "Intense" or "overwhelming" |
| "Failed treatment" | "Treatment wasn't a good fit" |
| "Non-compliant" | "Having difficulty with..." |
| "Attention-seeking" | "Communicating distress" |
| "Resistant" | "Not ready" or "ambivalent" |

**Empowering Language:**
- "Survivor" rather than "victim" (if patient prefers)
- "Experienced trauma" rather than "traumatized"
- Person-first language: "person with PTSD" not "PTSD patient"

### Managing Trauma Disclosure

**If Patient Discloses Trauma Details Spontaneously:**
- Listen without interruption
- Maintain calm, supportive presence
- Thank patient for sharing
- Gently refocus on symptoms (not trauma narrative)
- "Thank you for telling me. For this screening, I want to focus on how this is affecting you now. We can talk more about the details later if that's helpful."

**You Don't Need Trauma Details for Screening:**
- PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5 assess symptoms, not trauma narrative
- "You don't need to tell me what happened. I'm asking about how you've been feeling."
- Trauma narrative not required for screening or diagnosis

### Monitoring for Distress

**Signs of Dissociation/Overwhelm:**
- Blank stare, "spacing out"
- Sudden change in affect
- Fidgeting, restlessness
- Rapid breathing
- Disconnect from conversation

**Intervention:**
1. Stop assessment
2. Ground to present: "Can you tell me what you see in this room?"
3. Orient: "You're here with me, you're safe"
4. Ask: "What would help you feel safer right now?"
5. Consider deferring rest of assessment

## Special Screening Considerations

### PC-PTSD-5 Trauma-Informed Administration

**Prefacing Trauma Exposure Question:**
*"First I'll ask if you've experienced certain types of events. This is general - you don't need to give me details."*

**If Patient Says "No" to Trauma Exposure:**
- Respect response
- Don't pressure for disclosure
- Recognize trauma exposure may be too difficult to acknowledge
- Consider offering assessment at future time
- Provide resources anyway

**If Patient Says "Yes":**
- Thank for sharing
- Move to symptom questions
- Remind: "Now I'll ask about symptoms. You don't need to describe the event."

### PCL-5 Trauma-Informed Administration

**Before Beginning:**
*"These questions ask about symptoms you might be experiencing. You don't need to tell me about the trauma itself - just how you've been feeling lately."*

**Symptom-Focused:**
- PCL-5 assesses symptoms, not trauma narrative
- Redirect if patient starts sharing detailed trauma story (unless therapeutic to do so)
- Keep focus on "how this is affecting you now"

**After Completion:**
- Validate experience: "I know some of these questions can be difficult."
- Normalize reactions: "Some people find this brings up feelings. How are you doing?"
- Ground if needed

## Post-Screening Trauma-Informed Practice

### Delivering Results

**Collaborative Review:**
- Review results together
- Explain what scores mean in accessible language
- Emphasize hope: "PTSD is treatable"
- Avoid pathologizing language

**Sample Script for Positive Screen:**
*"Based on your responses, it looks like trauma is significantly affecting you right now. This is called PTSD - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This is a common reaction to trauma, and importantly, it's very treatable. Many people recover with the right support."*

### Safety Planning

**If Distress or Risk Identified:**
- Immediate safety assessment (see [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md))
- Develop safety plan collaboratively
- Provide crisis resources
- Schedule follow-up soon
- Don't leave patient in crisis state

### Resource Provision

**Always Provide:**
- Crisis hotline numbers (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Local crisis services
- Trauma treatment resources
- Support groups
- Educational materials about trauma and PTSD

**Written Resources:**
- Provide handouts about PTSD
- List of treatment options
- Self-care strategies
- Grounding techniques

### Follow-Up Planning

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- Clear plan for next appointment
- Specific recommendations
- Who patient can call if distress increases
- Collaborative decision about next steps

## Cultural Considerations in Trauma Screening

### Cultural Humility

**Recognize:**
- Trauma expression varies across cultures
- Some cultures emphasize somatic symptoms
- Collectivist cultures may focus on family/community impact
- Historical trauma affects marginalized communities

**Adapt:**
- Use culturally validated instruments when available
- Ask about cultural context: "In your culture, how do people typically respond to difficult experiences?"
- Respect cultural healing practices
- Consider cultural mistrust of mental health systems

### Historical Trauma

**Populations Affected:**
- Indigenous peoples (colonization, boarding schools)
- African Americans (slavery, racism, systemic oppression)
- Refugees and immigrants (war, displacement, persecution)
- LGBTQ+ individuals (discrimination, violence)

**Trauma-Informed Approach:**
- Acknowledge historical context
- Recognize intergenerational trauma
- Validate cultural mistrust
- Build trust through transparency and collaboration

### Language Access

**For Non-English Speakers:**
- Use professional interpreters (not family members)
- Use validated translations of assessments
- Allow extra time for interpretation
- Ensure interpreter understands trauma-informed approach

## Self-Care for Clinicians

### Vicarious Trauma Prevention

**Recognize Risk:**
- Exposure to trauma stories affects clinicians
- Compassion fatigue is real
- Burnout can impair trauma-informed care

**Self-Care Strategies:**
- Regular supervision/consultation
- Personal therapy if needed
- Peer support
- Maintain boundaries
- Balance caseload
- Engage in restorative activities

### Maintaining Trauma-Informed Practice

**Ongoing Development:**
- Regular training on trauma-informed care
- Cultural humility training
- Stay current on trauma research
- Reflect on own biases and reactions

## Red Flags: What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Practices

**❌ Forcing Disclosure**
- Never pressure patient to share trauma details
- Respect "I don't want to talk about it"
- Screening doesn't require trauma narrative

**❌ Minimizing**
- "It could have been worse"
- "You should be over it by now"
- "Other people have it worse"

**❌ Rushing**
- Completing screening despite visible distress
- Not allowing breaks
- Scheduled too tightly to manage reactions

**❌ Retraumatizing Questions**
- Asking for graphic details unnecessarily
- Repeatedly asking about trauma when patient declining
- Invasive questions about assault details

**❌ Blaming**
- Any suggestion patient caused trauma
- "Why didn't you...?"
- Implying patient should have prevented it

**❌ Breaking Confidentiality Without Warning**
- Surprise mandatory reporting
- Not explaining confidentiality limits upfront
