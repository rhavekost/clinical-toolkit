# Clinical Decision Trees for Anxiety

Treatment recommendations and clinical pathways based on GAD-7 severity levels.

## Overview

This guide provides evidence-based treatment recommendations based on GAD-7 scores and clinical presentation. Always use clinical judgment and individualize treatment.

## Primary Decision Tree

```
GAD-7 Administered
    ↓
What is total score?
    ↓
0-4 (Minimal) → Monitor, psychoeducation, reassess
5-9 (Mild) → Relaxation/stress management, reassess 2-4 weeks
10-14 (Moderate) → Active treatment (therapy or medication), monitor every 2-4 weeks
15-21 (Severe) → Active treatment (combination often recommended), close monitoring, specialty referral
```

## Minimal Anxiety (GAD-7: 0-4)

### Clinical Assessment
- No significant anxiety symptoms
- Normal functioning
- No treatment indicated for anxiety

### Recommended Actions

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess during routine care
- Annual GAD-7 screening

**Psychoeducation:**
- Discuss anxiety symptoms to watch for
- Stress management basics
- Healthy lifestyle (sleep, exercise, limit caffeine)

**When to Reassess Sooner:**
- Patient reports subjective distress despite low score
- Life stressors develop
- Symptoms emerge between routine visits

**Follow-up:**
- Next routine appointment or annually
- Patient instructed to contact if symptoms develop

## Mild Anxiety (GAD-7: 5-9)

### Clinical Assessment
- Mild symptoms with minimal functional impairment
- May be subsyndromal anxiety
- Consider watchful waiting before active treatment

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line: Self-Management and Behavioral Strategies**

1. **Relaxation Training:**
   - Deep breathing exercises
   - Progressive muscle relaxation
   - Mindfulness meditation
   - Guided imagery

2. **Stress Management:**
   - Identify stressors
   - Problem-solving strategies
   - Time management
   - Work-life balance

3. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Regular exercise (30+ min, 3-5x/week)
   - Sleep hygiene
   - Reduce caffeine and alcohol
   - Social support activation

4. **Psychoeducation:**
   - Nature of anxiety
   - Anxiety triggers
   - Self-care strategies
   - When to seek help

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess GAD-7 in 2-4 weeks
- Watch for worsening or improvement

**Decision Point at 2-4 Weeks:**

```
GAD-7 improved to 0-4?
    ↓ YES → Continue current approach, monitor
    ↓ NO
    ↓
GAD-7 stable (5-9)?
    ↓ Continue self-management 4-8 more weeks, or
    ↓ Consider initiating active treatment if:
      - Patient preference
      - Functional impairment
      - Symptoms distressing
    ↓
GAD-7 worsened (≥10)?
    ↓ YES → Move to Moderate Anxiety pathway
```

**When to Consider Active Treatment Earlier:**
- Patient preference for therapy or medication
- Significant functional impairment despite "mild" score
- Previous history of anxiety disorder (higher risk of progression)
- Persistent for >2 months without improvement

**Treatment Options if Active Treatment Indicated:**
- Psychotherapy (CBT for anxiety)
- OR medication (SSRI/SNRI)
- Consider patient preference

**Follow-up:**
- GAD-7 every 2-4 weeks during watchful waiting
- Every 2-4 weeks if treatment initiated

## Moderate Anxiety (GAD-7: 10-14)

### Clinical Assessment
- Meets threshold for anxiety disorder (89% sensitivity, 82% specificity at cutoff ≥10)
- Noticeable functional impairment
- Active treatment recommended

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line Treatment Options:**

Choose based on patient preference, availability, previous response:

1. **Psychotherapy alone:**
   - Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - first-line for anxiety
   - Weekly sessions initially
   - 8-12 week trial

2. **Medication alone:**
   - SSRI or SNRI first-line
   - Start low, titrate as needed
   - 4-8 week trial at therapeutic dose

3. **Combination therapy:**
   - Both medication and psychotherapy
   - May offer advantages for some patients
   - Consider if:
     - Previous partial response to monotherapy
     - Patient preference
     - Severe functional impairment

**Monitoring:**
- GAD-7 every 2-4 weeks
- Assess side effects if on medication
- Treatment response expected by 4-8 weeks

**Decision Point at 4-8 Weeks:**

```
GAD-7 decreased by ≥5 points?
    ↓ YES (Treatment Response)
    ↓ → Continue current treatment
    ↓ → Monitor for continued improvement
    ↓ → Target: GAD-7 < 5 (remission) or <10 (response)
    ↓
GAD-7 decreased by < 5 points OR worsened?
    ↓ (Inadequate Response)
    ↓ → Reassess diagnosis (rule out panic disorder, social anxiety, PTSD)
    ↓ → Check treatment adherence
    ↓ → Consider:
        - Increase treatment intensity (more frequent therapy, higher med dose)
        - Switch treatment (different therapy approach or medication)
        - Add treatment (combination if on monotherapy)
        - Refer for specialty evaluation
```

**Additional Assessments:**
- Rule out panic disorder (recurrent panic attacks)
- Rule out social anxiety disorder (fear of social situations)
- Assess for co-occurring depression (PHQ-9)
- Substance use assessment

**Referral Indications:**
- Inadequate response to initial treatment
- Patient request for specialty care
- Complicating factors (trauma, substance use)
- Need for specialized anxiety treatment

**Follow-up:**
- Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment
- Monthly once stable
- Continue GAD-7 monitoring

## Severe Anxiety (GAD-7: 15-21)

### Clinical Assessment
- Severe symptom burden
- Marked functional impairment
- High distress
- Active treatment strongly recommended

### Recommended Actions

**First-Line: Combination Therapy Often Recommended**

1. **Medication:**
   - SSRI or SNRI
   - Consider psychiatry referral for medication management
   - May need higher doses or augmentation

2. **Psychotherapy:**
   - CBT for anxiety (evidence-based)
   - Weekly sessions
   - Focus on exposure, cognitive restructuring, relaxation

**Monitoring:**
- **Close monitoring required**
- GAD-7 every 1-2 weeks initially
- May need more frequent contact (phone check-ins between sessions)

**Safety:**
- Assess for co-occurring depression and suicidal ideation (administer PHQ-9)
- Assess functional impairment (work, relationships, self-care)
- Consider impact on quality of life

**Decision Point at 4-8 Weeks:**

```
GAD-7 decreased to <10?
    ↓ YES → Good response, continue current treatment
    ↓
GAD-7 decreased by 5-9 points but still ≥10?
    ↓ Partial response
    ↓ → Continue current treatment, monitor closely
    ↓ → Consider augmentation or intensification
    ↓
GAD-7 < 5-point decrease OR worsened?
    ↓ Inadequate response
    ↓ → Specialty mental health referral if not already engaged
    ↓ → Consider higher level of care (IOP) if severe impairment
    ↓ → Reassess diagnosis (may be panic disorder, PTSD, OCD, etc.)
    ↓ → Rule out medical causes (hyperthyroidism, cardiac, etc.)
```

**Referral Strongly Recommended:**
- Specialty mental health evaluation
- Psychiatry for medication management
- Consider at initial presentation for severe anxiety

**Higher Level of Care Considerations:**

Consider IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) if:
- Inadequate response to standard outpatient treatment
- Severe functional impairment
- Co-occurring severe depression
- Need for intensive structure and support

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Panic Disorder (check for panic attacks)
- Social Anxiety Disorder
- PTSD (check trauma history)
- OCD (check for obsessions/compulsions)
- Medical anxiety (thyroid, cardiac, etc.)

**Follow-up:**
- Weekly or biweekly during acute phase
- Every 2-4 weeks once improving
- Frequent GAD-7 monitoring

## Special Considerations

### Panic Attacks

**If patient reports panic attacks:**
- GAD-7 screens for anxiety generally, not panic specifically
- Panic attacks may occur with GAD or as separate panic disorder
- Assess frequency, triggers, avoidance
- May need panic-focused treatment (exposure, interoceptive exposure)

### Social Anxiety

**If anxiety primarily in social situations:**
- May be social anxiety disorder rather than GAD
- GAD-7 will be elevated but doesn't distinguish
- Social anxiety requires exposure-based treatment
- Medication (SSRIs) also effective

### Health Anxiety

**If worry focused on health/illness:**
- May be health anxiety (formerly hypochondriasis)
- GAD-7 will be elevated
- Specific CBT for health anxiety needed
- Reassurance-seeking may maintain anxiety

### Obsessive-Compulsive Features

**If repetitive thoughts and behaviors:**
- May be OCD rather than or in addition to GAD
- GAD-7 will be elevated but doesn't assess compulsions
- OCD requires specific treatment (ERP - Exposure and Response Prevention)
- Different medication approach (higher SSRI doses)

### Medical Causes of Anxiety

**Rule out medical conditions:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Pheochromocytoma (rare)
- Medication side effects (steroids, stimulants)
- Substance use (caffeine, stimulants)
- Substance withdrawal (alcohol, benzodiazepines)

**Approach:**
- Basic medical workup if indicated (TSH, ECG, etc.)
- Treat medical conditions
- Still treat anxiety even if medical component present

### Co-occurring Depression

**Very common:**
- 60% of those with anxiety also have depression
- Administer both GAD-7 and PHQ-9
- Integrated treatment
- SSRIs/SNRIs treat both conditions

**Treatment approach:**
- Address both conditions
- CBT can target both anxiety and depression
- Medication typically addresses both
- Monitor both with GAD-7 and PHQ-9

### Substance Use

**Anxiety and substance use:**
- Substance use may be self-medication for anxiety
- Substances can cause or worsen anxiety
- Withdrawal can cause severe anxiety

**Approach:**
- Assess substance use
- May need substance use treatment first or concurrently
- Anxiety may improve with sobriety
- Reassess after stabilization

## Treatment Monitoring

### Regular GAD-7 Monitoring

**Frequency:**
- Every 2-4 weeks during active treatment (more frequent for severe)
- Monthly once stable
- Any time clinical concern

**Use scores to guide treatment:**
- Track improvement
- Identify plateaus
- Recognize worsening

### Treatment Response Definitions

**Minimal response:** < 5-point decrease
- Consider treatment change

**Partial response:** 5-9 point decrease but score still ≥10
- Continue treatment, monitor
- May need augmentation or more time

**Good response:** ≥5-point decrease AND score <10
- Significant improvement
- Continue treatment

**Remission:** GAD-7 < 5
- Goal of treatment
- Plan for maintenance and relapse prevention

## Medication Considerations

### First-Line Medications

**SSRIs:**
- Sertraline (Zoloft)
- Escitalopram (Lexapro)
- Paroxetine (Paxil)

**SNRIs:**
- Venlafaxine XR (Effexor XR)
- Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**Typical approach:**
- Start low, titrate gradually
- 4-8 weeks at therapeutic dose before assessing response
- Continue 6-12 months after remission
- Taper slowly when discontinuing

### Benzodiazepines

**Generally NOT first-line:**
- Risk of dependence
- Cognitive side effects
- Withdrawal issues

**May be used short-term:**
- Severe acute anxiety while waiting for SSRI to work
- Limited duration (2-4 weeks typically)
- Prefer PRN use over standing dose
- Taper when discontinuing

### Other Medications

**Buspirone:**
- Alternative for GAD
- No dependence risk
- Takes several weeks to work
- Less effective than SSRIs for many patients

**Hydroxyzine:**
- Antihistamine with anti-anxiety effects
- PRN use for acute anxiety
- No dependence risk
- Sedating

## Psychotherapy Approaches

### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**Gold standard for anxiety:**
- Identify and challenge anxious thoughts
- Behavioral experiments
- Exposure to feared situations
- Relaxation training

**Typical course:**
- 12-16 sessions
- Weekly initially
- Homework between sessions

### Exposure Therapy

**For specific fears/phobias:**
- Gradual exposure to feared situations
- Habituation to anxiety
- Very effective for panic, social anxiety, specific phobias

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

**Alternative to CBT:**
- Accept anxiety rather than fight it
- Mindfulness-based
- Values-based action
- Effective for GAD

### Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

**Mindfulness approach:**
- 8-week structured program
- Meditation practice
- Effective for anxiety and stress

## Relapse Prevention

### After Remission

**Continue treatment:**
- Medication: 6-12 months minimum after remission
- Therapy: Maintenance phase, less frequent sessions

**Monitor:**
- GAD-7 every 3-6 months
- Watch for early warning signs

**Relapse prevention planning:**
- Identify triggers
- Early warning signs
- Action plan if symptoms return
- Continue coping skills practice
