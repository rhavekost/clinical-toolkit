# 4AT Delirium Screen

## Purpose
Rapid screening for delirium and cognitive impairment.

## Intended Population
Adults (typically older adults) in acute care settings. Can be used in ED, wards, and postoperative settings.

## Inputs
The 4AT consists of four items:

1. **Alertness**
2. **AMT4** (age, date of birth, place, current year)
3. **Attention** (months of the year backwards)
4. **Acute change or fluctuating course**

## Scoring
| Item | Score |
|------|------|
| Alertness | 0 or 4 |
| AMT4 | 0, 1, or 2 |
| Attention | 0 or 1 or 2 |
| Acute change/fluctuation | 0 or 4 |

Total score range: 0 to 12.

## Interpretation
- **0:** delirium or severe cognitive impairment unlikely
- **1 to 3:** possible cognitive impairment
- **>=4:** possible delirium (with or without cognitive impairment)

## Limitations
- A screening tool; not diagnostic.
- Requires clinical correlation and follow-up assessment.

## Example
Alertness normal (0), AMT4 score 1, Attention score 1, Acute change present (4):
- Total = 6 (possible delirium)
