# Intake Interview

## Description

This skill provides structured interview guides and frameworks for comprehensive clinical intake assessment. These frameworks help ensure thorough evaluation while maintaining a conversational, patient-centered approach.

**Clinical Context:** Structured interviews help clinicians gather essential information systematically while building therapeutic rapport. These are support frameworks that guide, not replace, clinical judgment and individualized assessment.

## Available Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Population | Key Domains |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **HEADSS Assessment** | Psychosocial screening | Adolescents | Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Safety |
| **Biopsychosocial Template** | Comprehensive intake | All ages | Biological, psychological, social factors |
| **Safety Assessment Protocol** | Risk evaluation | All ages | Suicide, homicide, violence, safety planning |

## Usage

This skill can be invoked when you need to:
- Conduct a comprehensive intake interview
- Screen adolescents for psychosocial concerns
- Structure a biopsychosocial assessment
- Perform a systematic safety evaluation
- Ensure thorough documentation of intake

**Example requests:**
- "Help me conduct an intake interview"
- "Guide me through a HEADSS assessment"
- "I need a biopsychosocial interview template"
- "How do I structure a safety assessment?"

## Framework Details

### HEADSS Assessment (Adolescent Psychosocial Screening)

**Purpose:** Structured framework for adolescent psychosocial screening covering key risk and protective factors.

**Domains:**
- **H - Home:** Living situation, family relationships, household stressors
- **E - Education/Employment:** School performance, attendance, peer relationships
- **A - Activities:** Hobbies, sports, peer groups, screen time
- **D - Drugs:** Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, drugs), peer use
- **S - Sexuality:** Sexual activity, orientation, safety, relationships
- **S - Suicide/Safety:** Mental health, self-harm, violence exposure

*[Detailed question guides for each domain to be added]*

### Biopsychosocial Template

**Purpose:** Comprehensive intake structure addressing biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to current presentation.

**Biological Factors:**
- Medical history, current medications
- Sleep, appetite, energy
- Substance use
- Family medical/psychiatric history

**Psychological Factors:**
- Mental status examination
- Current symptoms and timeline
- Previous mental health treatment
- Trauma history
- Coping strategies

**Social Factors:**
- Relationships and support system
- Living situation and safety
- Employment/education/finances
- Cultural and spiritual factors
- Legal involvement

*[Detailed interview guide and documentation template to be added]*

### Safety Assessment Protocol

**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of suicide, homicide, and safety risks with clear decision pathways.

**Key Components:**
1. **Suicide Risk Assessment**
   - Current ideation, intent, plan, means
   - Prior attempts and self-harm
   - Protective factors
   - Risk stratification

2. **Violence Risk Assessment**
   - Homicidal ideation
   - History of violence
   - Access to weapons
   - Target identification

3. **Safety Planning**
   - Warning signs
   - Coping strategies
   - Support contacts
   - Means restriction
   - Emergency resources

4. **Disposition Decision**
   - Level of care determination
   - Follow-up planning
   - Documentation requirements

*[Detailed protocol and decision trees to be added]*

## Clinical Interpretation

*[Guidelines for synthesizing intake information into clinical formulation to be added]*

**Key Questions:**
- What is the presenting problem and precipitants?
- What biological, psychological, and social factors contribute?
- What are the patient's strengths and resources?
- What level of care is appropriate?
- What are the treatment priorities?

## Safety Protocols

**During intake assessment:**
- Assess safety concerns early in interview
- Be prepared to interrupt interview flow for safety issues
- Have emergency protocols readily available
- Know your crisis resources and referral pathways
- Document all safety concerns and interventions

**Mandatory Reporting:**
- Be aware of mandatory reporting requirements (child abuse, elder abuse, danger to others)
- Explain confidentiality limits at start of interview
- Consult when uncertain about reporting obligations

*[Detailed safety protocols and escalation pathways to be added]*

## Limitations & Considerations

**These are support frameworks, not rigid protocols:**
- Adapt to patient's presentation and needs
- Maintain conversational, empathic approach
- Cultural humility in all assessments
- Trauma-informed approach
- Language and health literacy considerations
- Allow patient to guide pacing and depth
- Clinical judgment supersedes checklist completion

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Family structure and roles vary across cultures
- Expression of distress differs
- Help-seeking behaviors culturally influenced
- Spirituality and traditional healing
- Immigration and acculturation stress
- Interpreter services when needed

**Trauma-Informed Approach:**
- Establish safety and choice
- Transparency about process
- Allow patient control over disclosure
- Recognize potential for re-traumatization
- Avoid forcing trauma narrative in initial intake

*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*
