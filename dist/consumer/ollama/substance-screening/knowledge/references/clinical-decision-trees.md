         |
         v
3. Set Goals (if ready)

Patient reports daily/near-daily heavy drinking + wants to stop/reduce
         |
         v
Assess withdrawal risk using CIWA-Ar or similar
         |
         v
History of withdrawal? Seizures? Delirium tremens?
         |
         +-- High Risk (previous severe withdrawal, heavy prolonged use)
         |        |
         |        v
         |   Medically Supervised Detoxification
         |        |
         |        +-- Inpatient detox
         |        |   - Seizure history
         |        |   - DT history
         |        |   - Medical comorbidity
         |        |   - Unable to abstain as outpatient
         |        |
         |        +-- Outpatient detox (selected patients)
         |            - Close monitoring (daily initially)
         |            - Benzodiazepine taper
         |            - Supportive care
         |            - Readily available support
         |
         +-- Moderate Risk (daily drinking, mild past withdrawal)
         |        |
         |        v
         |   Outpatient Management
         |        |
         |        v
         |   - Benzodiazepine taper (symptom-triggered or fixed-dose)
         |   - Close follow-up (every 1-3 days initially)
         |   - Thiamine supplementation
         |   - Instructions on when to go to ED
         |
         +-- Low Risk (drinking stopped or reduced, no withdrawal symptoms)
                  |
                  v
            Monitor without medications
                  |
                  v
            - Check in regularly
            - Watch for symptoms
            - Thiamine supplementation
            - Education on withdrawal signs
```

### Opioid Withdrawal Assessment

```
Patient reports daily opioid use + wants to stop
         |
         v
Assess withdrawal severity
         |
         +-- Opioid withdrawal is NOT life-threatening (unlike alcohol)
         |   (but very uncomfortable and high relapse risk)
         |
         v
Treatment Options
         |
         +-- Medication-Assisted Treatment (PREFERRED)
         |        |
         |        v
         |   Buprenorphine induction
         |        |
         |        v
         |   - Wait for mild-moderate withdrawal (COWS 8-12)
         |   - Start buprenorphine
         |   - Suppress withdrawal
         |   - Transition to maintenance
         |   - Long-term MAT (best outcomes)
         |
         +-- Medically Supervised Withdrawal (NOT PREFERRED)
         |        |
         |        v
         |   Comfort medications only
         |        |
         |        v
         |   - High relapse rate (>80%)
         |   - Should transition to MAT
         |   - Use only if patient refuses MAT
         |   - Medications: clonidine, ondansetron, NSAIDs, etc.

**RECOMMENDATION: Strongly encourage MAT over detox-only**
**Evidence shows MAT superior to abstinence-based treatment for OUD**

## Treatment Recommendations by Severity

### AUDIT-C Based Recommendations

| Men's Score | Women's Score | Severity | Recommended Intervention |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-------------------------|
| 0-3 | 0-2 | Low risk | Positive feedback, annual rescreen |
| 4-5 | 3-4 | Hazardous | Brief intervention, education, 1-3 month f/u |
| 6-7 | 5-7 | Harmful | Full AUDIT, brief intervention, consider specialty referral |
| 8-12 | 8-12 | Severe | Full AUDIT, specialty addiction treatment referral required |

### DAST-10 Based Recommendations

| Score | Severity | Recommended Intervention |
|-------|----------|-------------------------|
| 0-2 | Minimal | Positive feedback, routine monitoring |
| 3-5 | Moderate | Comprehensive assessment, motivational interviewing, consider outpatient treatment |
| 6-8 | Substantial | Specialty addiction treatment referral, determine substances, MAT if opioids, IOP/PHP level |
| 9-10 | Severe | Immediate specialty referral, higher level of care consideration, comprehensive services |

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy

```
Any substance use in pregnancy
         |
         v
Immediate referral to:
1. Prenatal care (if not already connected)
2. Perinatal substance use program
         |
         v
Opioid use in pregnancy?
         |
         +-- YES
         |        |
         |        v

         |        v
         |   - Buprenorphine or methadone (NOT naltrexone)
         |   - Do NOT detox (fetal risk)
         |   - MAT safer than continued illicit use
         |   - Coordinate obstetric + addiction care
         |
         +-- Alcohol use in pregnancy
         |        |
         |        v
         |   - Strong recommendation for abstinence
         |   - No safe level of alcohol in pregnancy
         |   - Brief intervention
         |   - Intensive support
         |
         +-- Other drug use
                  |
                  v
            - Assess specific substances
            - Harm reduction if unable to abstain
            - Close monitoring
            - Integrated prenatal + substance use care
```

### Adolescents/Young Adults

- Different screening tools may be more appropriate (CRAFFT for adolescents)
- Early intervention critical (developing brains)
- Family involvement important
- Specialized adolescent treatment programs when available
- Address developmental stage in treatment planning

### Older Adults

- May need lower cutoffs (physiological changes with aging)
- Prescription drug misuse common
- Alcohol-medication interactions significant
- Cognitive screening if impairment
- Assess fall risk

## Summary: Quick Reference Treatment Pathways

**AUDIT-C Positive:**
- Score 4-7 (Men) or 3-7 (Women) → Brief intervention ± full AUDIT
- Score ≥8 → Specialty referral + withdrawal assessment

**DAST-10 Positive:**
- Score 3-5 → Assess for SUD, consider outpatient treatment
- Score ≥6 → Specialty referral required
- **If opioids** → MAT discussion immediately
- **If stimulants** → Behavioral treatment, cardiac/psych evaluation
- **If injection use** → Infectious disease screening, harm reduction

**Always:**
- Screen for co-occurring mental health disorders
- Assess suicide risk
- Provide crisis resources
- Consider harm reduction approaches
- Engage patient in collaborative treatment planning
