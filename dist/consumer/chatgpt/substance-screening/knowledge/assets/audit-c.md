# Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Concise (AUDIT-C)

## Overview
- **Items:** 3
- **Time:** < 1 minute
- **Purpose:** Brief screen for hazardous drinking and active alcohol use disorders
- **Population:** Adults (18+), validated in primary care and general medical settings
- **Response Format:** 0-4 point scale for each item

## Items

**Response Scale varies by question (see below)**

1. **How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?**
   - 0 = Never
   - 1 = Monthly or less
   - 2 = 2-4 times a month
   - 3 = 2-3 times a week
   - 4 = 4 or more times a week

2. **How many standard drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when drinking?**
   - 0 = 1 or 2
   - 1 = 3 or 4
   - 2 = 5 or 6
   - 3 = 7 to 9
   - 4 = 10 or more

3. **How often do you have 6 or more drinks on one occasion?**
   - 0 = Never
   - 1 = Less than monthly
   - 2 = Monthly
   - 3 = Weekly
   - 4 = Daily or almost daily

**Standard Drink Definition:**
- 12 oz beer (5% alcohol)
- 5 oz wine (12% alcohol)
- 1.5 oz spirits/liquor (40% alcohol)

## Scoring

**Algorithm:**
1. Sum responses to all 3 items
2. Total score range: 0-12
3. Higher scores indicate greater risk

**Interpretation:**

### Men
- **0-3:** Negative screen - Low risk
- **≥4:** Positive screen - Possible alcohol use disorder, further assessment recommended

### Women
- **0-2:** Negative screen - Low risk
- **≥3:** Positive screen - Possible alcohol use disorder, further assessment recommended

**Note:** Lower cutoff for women reflects physiological differences in alcohol metabolism and increased health risks at lower consumption levels.

**Clinical Significance:**
- AUDIT-C is first 3 items of full 10-item AUDIT
- Efficient screening tool with strong psychometric properties
- Sensitivity: 86% for hazardous drinking, 85% for alcohol dependence
- Specificity: 72% for hazardous drinking, 89% for alcohol dependence
- Positive screen warrants brief intervention or full AUDIT assessment

## Risk Categories

### Low Risk (Men 0-3, Women 0-2)
**Interpretation:** Drinking within low-risk guidelines or no alcohol use

**Recommended Actions:**
- Provide positive feedback
- Encourage continued low-risk drinking
- No intervention typically needed

### Hazardous Drinking (Men 4-5, Women 3-4)
**Interpretation:** Drinking above recommended limits, increased risk of harm

**Recommended Actions:**
- Brief intervention recommended
- Provide feedback on drinking levels
- Discuss health risks
- Set goals for reducing consumption
- Follow-up in 1-3 months

### Harmful/High Risk (Men 6-7, Women 5-7)
**Interpretation:** Drinking pattern likely causing current harm or high risk for serious consequences

**Recommended Actions:**
- Brief intervention required
- Consider full AUDIT assessment
- Assess for alcohol use disorder criteria
- Referral for specialty treatment if indicated
- Close monitoring

### Severe Risk (Men 8-12, Women 8-12)
**Interpretation:** Very high likelihood of alcohol use disorder requiring treatment

**Recommended Actions:**
- Full AUDIT assessment recommended
- Comprehensive evaluation for alcohol use disorder
- Specialty addiction treatment referral
- Consider medication-assisted treatment
- Address withdrawal risk
- Coordinate care
