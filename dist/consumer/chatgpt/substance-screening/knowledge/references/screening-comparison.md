## AUDIT-C (Alcohol)

### When to Use AUDIT-C

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **Universal Screening in Primary Care**
   - Annual wellness visits
   - New patient intake
   - Pre-procedure assessments
   - Routine medical visits
   - Time-limited settings

2. **Quick Triage**
   - Emergency department screening
   - Urgent care visits
   - Brief medical encounters
   - Population health initiatives

3. **Repeat Screening**
   - Monitoring previously negative patients
   - Annual rescreening
   - Post-treatment monitoring for stable patients

### Advantages
- Extremely brief (< 1 minute)
- Easy to administer and score
- Can be integrated into vital signs workflow
- Strong psychometric properties
- High sensitivity for hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder
- Gender-specific cutoffs account for physiological differences
- Validated across diverse populations

### Limitations
- **Alcohol only** (does not screen for drug use)
- Limited assessment of consequences
- No assessment of dependence symptoms
- May miss some cases of alcohol use disorder
- Focuses on quantity/frequency, not problems
- Positive screen requires follow-up

### What AUDIT-C Misses
- Specific consequences of drinking (work problems, relationship issues)
- Dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control)
- Morning drinking
- Alcohol-related injuries
- Concern from others beyond binge drinking

### Follow-Up After Positive AUDIT-C
**If AUDIT-C ≥ cutoff:**
- **Option 1:** Administer full 10-item AUDIT for comprehensive assessment
- **Option 2:** Provide brief intervention + reassess in 1-3 months
- **Option 3:** Refer directly to specialty treatment if score very high (≥8)

**Full AUDIT adds 7 items assessing:**
- Inability to stop drinking once started
- Failure to meet normal expectations due to drinking
- Need for morning drink
- Guilt or remorse after drinking
- Alcohol-related amnesia/blackouts
- Injuries due to drinking
- Others' concern about drinking

## DAST-10 (Drugs)

### When to Use DAST-10

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **Drug Use Screening**
   - Universal screening in medical/mental health settings
   - Emergency department presentations
   - Pre-operative assessments
   - Pain management clinic intake
   - Psychiatric intake

2. **When Substance Use Suspected**
   - Unexplained symptoms
   - Behavioral changes
   - Patient self-report of concerns
   - Positive urine drug screen follow-up

3. **Treatment Settings**
   - Baseline before substance use treatment
   - Progress monitoring during treatment
   - Relapse assessment
   - Treatment outcome measurement

### Advantages
- Covers all drug types (not substance-specific)
- Assesses consequences and dependence, not just use
- Brief but more comprehensive than simple quantity/frequency
- High reliability and validity
- Sensitive to treatment changes
- Widely used and validated
- Public domain (free to use)

### Limitations
- **Does not screen for alcohol** (use AUDIT-C separately)
- Does not distinguish between drug types (need follow-up questions)
- Self-report may underestimate use
- May miss very recent initiation of drug use
- 12-month timeframe may miss recent onset
- Does not assess current intoxication or withdrawal

### What DAST-10 Assesses
- **Breadth of use:** Multiple drugs (Item 2)
- **Control:** Inability to stop (Item 3)
- **Acute effects:** Blackouts, flashbacks (Item 4)
- **Emotional impact:** Guilt (Item 5)
- **Social consequences:** Family complaints, neglect (Items 6, 7)
- **Severity indicators:** Illegal activities, withdrawal, medical problems (Items 8, 9, 10)

### Follow-Up After Positive DAST-10
**If DAST-10 ≥3:**
- **Required:** Detailed substance use history
  - Specific substances used (cannabis, opioids, stimulants, etc.)
  - Frequency and quantity for each substance
  - Route of administration (oral, nasal, injection, smoking)
  - Age of first use and progression
  - Previous treatment attempts
- Assess for DSM-5 substance use disorder
- Determine appropriate level of care
- Screen for co-occurring mental health disorders
- Medical evaluation if high score or specific substances

## Full AUDIT (10 Items)

### When to Use Full AUDIT

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **After Positive AUDIT-C**
   - AUDIT-C ≥ cutoff warrants full assessment
   - Provides comprehensive alcohol problem assessment

2. **Suspected Alcohol Use Disorder**
   - Clinical presentation suggests AUD
   - Patient reports alcohol concerns
   - Medical complications possibly alcohol-related

3. **Treatment Planning**
   - Baseline before alcohol treatment
   - Determining severity of alcohol use disorder
   - Treatment matching (brief intervention vs. specialty care)

4. **Treatment Monitoring**
   - Detailed progress tracking
   - Measuring treatment response
   - Relapse assessment

### Advantages
- **Comprehensive:** Consumption + consequences + dependence
- Three subscales:
  - Hazardous alcohol use (Items 1-3) - same as AUDIT-C
  - Dependence symptoms (Items 4-6)
  - Harmful alcohol use (Items 7-10)
- Better treatment monitoring than AUDIT-C alone
- Identifies specific problem areas for intervention
- Validated WHO instrument, extensive research base

### Full AUDIT Score Interpretation
- **0-7:** Low risk
- **8-15:** Hazardous use (brief intervention)
- **16-19:** Harmful use (brief intervention + counseling)
- **20-40:** Possible dependence (specialty evaluation)

**Severity zones:**
- Zone I (0-7): Alcohol education
- Zone II (8-15): Simple advice
- Zone III (16-19): Simple advice + brief counseling + continued monitoring
- Zone IV (20-40): Referral to specialist for diagnostic evaluation and treatment

### When Full AUDIT Not Needed
- AUDIT-C negative and no clinical concern
- Patient already in alcohol treatment (treatment-specific measures better)
- Time very limited (use AUDIT-C for screening)

## Combined Screening Strategy

### Recommended Approach for Primary Care

**Universal Screening Protocol:**
1. **Everyone:** AUDIT-C (alcohol) + DAST-10 (drugs)
   - Can be done simultaneously
   - < 5 minutes total
   - Captures both alcohol and drug use

2. **If AUDIT-C positive (≥cutoff):**
   - Administer full AUDIT for comprehensive alcohol assessment
   - OR provide brief intervention and reassess

3. **If DAST-10 positive (≥3):**
   - Detailed substance use history
   - Assess specific substances
   - Determine treatment needs

**This strategy:**
- Efficient screening for all substance use
- Low burden for negative screens
- Comprehensive assessment for positive screens
- Evidence-based cutoffs for intervention

### Screening Frequency Recommendations

**Annual screening for all adults (USPSTF recommendation):**
- AUDIT-C at every annual visit
- DAST-10 at annual visit or when clinically indicated

**More frequent screening:**
- Adolescents and young adults (every visit)
- Individuals with substance use history (every visit)
- Pregnant individuals (every prenatal visit)
- Emergency department visits
- Before prescribing controlled substances

**Treatment monitoring:**
- Monthly AUDIT-C during alcohol treatment
- Monthly DAST-10 during drug treatment
- Full AUDIT quarterly for detailed assessment

## Special Clinical Situations

### Emergency Department Screening

**Best approach: AUDIT-C + DAST-10**
- Quick triage tools
- Identify candidates for brief intervention
- Risk stratification for medical complications

**Do not delay medical care for screening:**
- Stabilize patient first
- Screen when patient alert and able to respond
- May defer screening if severely ill

### Pre-Operative Screening

**Best approach: AUDIT-C + DAST-10**
- Identify alcohol withdrawal risk post-op
- Identify drug use affecting anesthesia
- Assess need for perioperative monitoring

**AUDIT-C ≥4 (men) or ≥3 (women):**
- Inform anesthesia team
- Prevent post-operative withdrawal
- Consider prophylactic benzodiazepines

**DAST-10 positive:**
- Inform anesthesia (drug interactions, tolerance)
- Opioid use disorder: pain management planning
- Benzodiazepine use: withdrawal prevention

### Pregnancy Screening

**Alcohol: AUDIT-C essential**
- **Any alcohol use in pregnancy = high risk**
- Screen at first prenatal visit
- Rescreen each trimester
- Brief intervention for any positive response

**Drugs: DAST-10 + specific questions**
- **Any drug use in pregnancy = high risk**
- Immediate referral to perinatal substance use services
- Do not abruptly stop opioids (fetal risk)
- Medication-assisted treatment preferred

### Pain Management Settings

**DAST-10 essential before opioid prescribing**
- Assess risk for opioid use disorder
- History of substance use disorder = higher risk
- May require enhanced monitoring
- Consider opioid risk assessment tools in addition

**AUDIT-C also recommended:**
- Alcohol + opioids = overdose risk
- Alcohol use disorder complicates pain management

### Mental Health Settings

**Both AUDIT-C and DAST-10 essential**
- High comorbidity between substance use and mental health disorders
- Substance use can mimic psychiatric symptoms
- May need to address substance use before treating mental health condition
- Integrated treatment when both present

## Common Clinical Questions

### "Should I screen for both alcohol and drugs?"
**Yes**, ideally. They often co-occur and have different treatments.
- AUDIT-C + DAST-10 takes < 5 minutes total
- Captures both alcohol and drug problems
- Many patients use multiple substances

### "Can I just ask 'Do you drink?' instead of AUDIT-C?"
**No**. Simple yes/no questions miss most hazardous drinking.
- Patients often don't recognize their drinking as problematic
- Quantity/frequency questions (AUDIT-C) are more sensitive
- Standardized screening superior to clinical judgment alone

### "My patient drinks every day but scored low on AUDIT-C. How is that possible?"
**AUDIT-C scores by quantity and frequency:**
- Daily drinking of 1-2 drinks = lower score
- Less frequent but heavy binge drinking = higher score
- AUDIT-C designed to catch hazardous drinking patterns
- If clinical concern despite low score, administer full AUDIT

### "Patient scored high on DAST-10 but only uses cannabis. Is that really a problem?"
**Yes, if it's causing problems (which DAST-10 assesses):**
- DAST-10 score reflects consequences, not just use
- High score means multiple problem areas endorsed
- Cannabis can cause significant impairment in some individuals
- Take score seriously regardless of substance

### "Should I use urine drug testing instead of DAST-10?"
**No - they serve different purposes:**
- Urine drug screen: detects recent use (24-72 hours typically)
- DAST-10: assesses problems and severity (past 12 months)
- Both have roles:
  - DAST-10: screening and severity assessment
  - UDS: confirming substances, monitoring treatment compliance

**Use both when clinically indicated:**
- DAST-10 positive: UDS can identify specific substances
- UDS positive: DAST-10 assesses severity and need for treatment

### "Do I need patient permission to screen?"
**Screening is part of routine medical care:**
- Explain it's standard practice (like blood pressure)
- Patient can decline (but encourage participation)
- Normalize: "I ask all my patients these questions"
- Assure confidentiality (within limits)

**Mandatory reporting considerations:**
- Understand your jurisdiction's laws
- Some states require reporting in pregnancy
- Always explain confidentiality limits upfront

## Integration with Other Screening

**Substance screening often done alongside:**
- Depression screening: See ../../depression-screening/ (PHQ-9)
- Anxiety screening: See ../../anxiety-screening/ (GAD-7)
- PTSD screening: See ../../trauma-screening/ (PC-PTSD-5)
- Suicide screening: See ../../suicide-screening/ (ASQ, C-SSRS)

**High comorbidity requires integrated screening approach**

## Summary Recommendations

**For universal screening in primary care:**
- **Use AUDIT-C + DAST-10** (both, every patient, annually)

**For positive AUDIT-C:**
- **Administer full AUDIT** for comprehensive assessment
- Or provide brief intervention and monitor

**For positive DAST-10:**
- **Detailed substance use history** (specific substances, severity)
- Comprehensive assessment for substance use disorder

**For specialty substance use settings:**
- Full AUDIT for alcohol treatment planning
- DAST-10 for drug treatment monitoring
- Consider substance-specific tools as needed

**Remember:**
- Screening is first step, not diagnosis
- Positive screens require clinical follow-up
- Integrate substance screening with overall care
- Use screening to guide intervention and referral
