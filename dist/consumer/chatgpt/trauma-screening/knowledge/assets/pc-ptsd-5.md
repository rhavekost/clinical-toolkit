# Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5)

## Overview
- **Items:** 5
- **Time:** 1-2 minutes
- **Purpose:** Brief screen for PTSD in primary care and general medical settings
- **Population:** Adults (18+) with known trauma exposure
- **Response Format:** Binary (Yes/No)

## Items

Sometimes things happen to people that are unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. For example:
- A serious accident or fire
- A physical or sexual assault or abuse
- An earthquake or flood
- A war
- Seeing someone be killed or seriously injured
- Having a loved one die through homicide or suicide

**Have you ever experienced this kind of event?**

If YES, please answer the following questions about the event:

**Response Scale:**
- Yes (1 point)
- No (0 points)

1. In the past month, have you had nightmares about the event(s) or thought about the event(s) when you did not want to?
2. In the past month, have you tried hard not to think about the event(s) or went out of your way to avoid situations that reminded you of the event(s)?
3. In the past month, have you been constantly on guard, watchful, or easily startled?
4. In the past month, have you felt numb or detached from people, activities, or your surroundings?
5. In the past month, have you felt guilty or unable to stop blaming yourself or others for the event(s) or any problems the event(s) may have caused?

## Scoring

**Algorithm:**
1. Count "Yes" responses
2. Total score range: 0-5
3. Each "Yes" = 1 point

**Interpretation:**
- 0-2: Negative screen - PTSD unlikely
- ≥3: Positive screen - Further assessment recommended with PCL-5

For detailed interpretation and next steps, see [references/severity-levels.md](../references/severity-levels.md) and [references/screening-comparison.md](../references/screening-comparison.md)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Cutoff ≥3: Optimal balance of sensitivity (93%) and specificity (85%)
- Positive screen warrants full PTSD assessment (PCL-5)
- Designed as brief triage tool, not diagnostic instrument
- Requires trauma exposure; not administered if no trauma history
