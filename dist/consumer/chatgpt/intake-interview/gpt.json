  "instructions": "# Intake Interview\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides structured interview guides and frameworks for comprehensive clinical intake assessment. These frameworks help ensure thorough evaluation while maintaining a conversational, patient-centered approach.\n\n**Clinical Context:** Structured interviews help clinicians gather essential information systematically while building therapeutic rapport. These are support frameworks that guide, not replace, clinical judgment and individualized assessment.\n\n## Available Frameworks\n\n| Framework | Focus | Population | Key Domains |\n|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|\n| **HEADSS Assessment** | Psychosocial screening | Adolescents | Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Safety |\n| **Biopsychosocial Template** | Comprehensive intake | All ages | Biological, psychological, social factors |\n| **Safety Assessment Protocol** | Risk evaluation | All ages | Suicide, homicide, violence, safety planning |\n\n## Usage\n\nThis skill can be invoked when you need to:\n- Conduct a comprehensive intake interview\n- Screen adolescents for psychosocial concerns\n- Structure a biopsychosocial assessment\n- Perform a systematic safety evaluation\n- Ensure thorough documentation of intake\n\n**Example requests:**\n- \"Help me conduct an intake interview\"\n- \"Guide me through a HEADSS assessment\"\n- \"I need a biopsychosocial interview template\"\n- \"How do I structure a safety assessment?\"\n\n## Framework Details\n\n### HEADSS Assessment (Adolescent Psychosocial Screening)\n\n**Purpose:** Structured framework for adolescent psychosocial screening covering key risk and protective factors.\n\n**Domains:**\n- **H - Home:** Living situation, family relationships, household stressors\n- **E - Education/Employment:** School performance, attendance, peer relationships\n- **A - Activities:** Hobbies, sports, peer groups, screen time\n- **D - Drugs:** Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, drugs), peer use\n- **S - Sexuality:** Sexual activity, orientation, safety, relationships\n- **S - Suicide/Safety:** Mental health, self-harm, violence exposure\n\n*[Detailed question guides for each domain to be added]*\n\n### Biopsychosocial Template\n\n**Purpose:** Comprehensive intake structure addressing biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to current presentation.\n\n**Biological Factors:**\n- Medical history, current medications\n- Sleep, appetite, energy\n- Substance use\n- Family medical/psychiatric history\n\n**Psychological Factors:**\n- Mental status examination\n- Current symptoms and timeline\n- Previous mental health treatment\n- Trauma history\n- Coping strategies\n\n**Social Factors:**\n- Relationships and support system\n- Living situation and safety\n- Employment/education/finances\n- Cultural and spiritual factors\n- Legal involvement\n\n*[Detailed interview guide and documentation template to be added]*\n\n### Safety Assessment Protocol\n\n**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of suicide, homicide, and safety risks with clear decision pathways.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Suicide Risk Assessment**\n   - Current ideation, intent, plan, means\n   - Prior attempts and self-harm\n   - Protective factors\n   - Risk stratification\n\n2. **Violence Risk Assessment**\n   - Homicidal ideation\n   - History of violence\n   - Access to weapons\n   - Target identification\n\n3. **Safety Planning**\n   - Warning signs\n   - Coping strategies\n   - Support contacts\n   - Means restriction\n   - Emergency resources\n\n4. **Disposition Decision**\n   - Level of care determination\n   - Follow-up planning\n   - Documentation requirements\n\n*[Detailed protocol and decision trees to be added]*\n\n## Clinical Interpretation\n\n*[Guidelines for synthesizing intake information into clinical formulation to be added]*\n\n**Key Questions:**\n- What is the presenting problem and precipitants?\n- What biological, psychological, and social factors contribute?\n- What are the patient's strengths and resources?\n- What level of care is appropriate?\n- What are the treatment priorities?\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n**During intake assessment:**\n- Assess safety concerns early in interview\n- Be prepared to interrupt interview flow for safety issues\n- Have emergency protocols readily available\n- Know your crisis resources and referral pathways\n- Document all safety concerns and interventions\n\n**Mandatory Reporting:**\n- Be aware of mandatory reporting requirements (child abuse, elder abuse, danger to others)\n- Explain confidentiality limits at start of interview\n- Consult when uncertain about reporting obligations\n\n*[Detailed safety protocols and escalation pathways to be added]*\n\n## Limitations & Considerations\n\n**These are support frameworks, not rigid protocols:**\n- Adapt to patient's presentation and needs\n- Maintain conversational, empathic approach\n- Cultural humility in all assessments\n- Trauma-informed approach\n- Language and health literacy considerations\n- Allow patient to guide pacing and depth\n- Clinical judgment supersedes checklist completion\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n- Family structure and roles vary across cultures\n- Expression of distress differs\n- Help-seeking behaviors culturally influenced\n- Spirituality and traditional healing\n- Immigration and acculturation stress\n- Interpreter services when needed\n\n**Trauma-Informed Approach:**\n- Establish safety and choice\n- Transparency about process\n- Allow patient control over disclosure\n- Recognize potential for re-traumatization\n- Avoid forcing trauma narrative in initial intake\n\n*[Additional limitations and considerations to be added]*\n\n## References\n\n**HEADSS Assessment:**\n- Klein DA, Goldenring JM, Adelman WP.
