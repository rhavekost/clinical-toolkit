# Depression Severity Levels

This reference provides detailed interpretation of depression severity across PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 screening tools.

## PHQ-9 Severity Levels

### Minimal Depression (0-4)
**Clinical Meaning:** No or minimal depression symptoms. Within normal range.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Rare or absent depressive symptoms
- Minimal functional impairment
- No treatment typically indicated

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor during routine care
- Provide psychoeducation about depression
- Reassess if symptoms change

### Mild Depression (5-9)
**Clinical Meaning:** Mild depression symptoms with minimal functional impairment.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Some depressive symptoms present
- Mild impact on daily functioning
- Patient often continues normal activities with effort

**Recommended Actions:**
- Watchful waiting with close follow-up
- Behavioral activation and self-care strategies
- Consider brief counseling or support
- Reassess in 2-4 weeks

### Moderate Depression (10-14)
**Clinical Meaning:** Moderate depression symptoms with noticeable functional impairment. Meets threshold for major depression diagnosis (88% sensitivity/specificity at cutoff of 10).

**Typical Presentation:**
- Clear depressive symptoms
- Functional impairment in work, social, or personal domains
- Patient struggles with daily activities

**Recommended Actions:**
- Active treatment plan required
- Consider psychotherapy and/or medication
- Regular monitoring (every 2-4 weeks)
- Assess safety and support systems

### Moderately Severe Depression (15-19)
**Clinical Meaning:** Moderately severe depression with significant functional impairment.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Pervasive depressive symptoms
- Significant impairment in multiple life domains
- May have difficulty completing routine tasks

**Recommended Actions:**
- Active treatment strongly recommended
- Combination therapy (medication + psychotherapy) often indicated
- Close monitoring (weekly or biweekly)
- Safety assessment at each contact
- Consider referral for specialty mental health care

### Severe Depression (20-27)
**Clinical Meaning:** Severe depression with marked functional impairment. High risk for complications.

**Typical Presentation:**
- Severe, pervasive symptoms
- Marked impairment in all life domains
- May include psychotic features
- High suicide risk

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediate treatment required
- Specialty mental health referral
- Close monitoring (at least weekly)
- Thorough safety assessment
- Consider higher level of care (IOP, PHP, inpatient) if:
  - Suicidal ideation present
  - Psychotic features
  - Inability to care for self
  - Inadequate outpatient response

## PHQ-2 Interpretation

### Negative Screen (0-2)
**Meaning:** Low probability of depression.

**Actions:**
- Routine monitoring during regular care
- Reassess if clinical presentation changes
- No PHQ-9 needed unless clinical concern

### Positive Screen (≥3)
**Meaning:** Elevated depression symptoms warrant further assessment.

**Actions:**
- Administer full PHQ-9
- Do not diagnose based on PHQ-2 alone
- PHQ-2 is a screener, not diagnostic tool

## Treatment Response Monitoring

### Minimal Response (< 5-point decrease)
- Reassess treatment plan
- Consider treatment intensification
- Rule out barriers to treatment adherence

### Partial Response (5-9 point decrease)
- Continue current treatment
- Monitor progress closely
- Consider augmentation if plateaued

### Good Response (≥10-point decrease)
- Clinically significant improvement
- Continue current treatment
- Plan for maintenance and relapse prevention

## Special Considerations

### Item 9 Suicidal Ideation
Regardless of total score, any positive response (>0) on Item 9 requires immediate safety assessment. See `item-9-safety-protocol.md` and `../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md`

### Cultural Factors
- Somatic symptoms (items 3, 4, 5, 8) may be more prominent in some cultural groups
- Expression of mood symptoms varies across cultures
- Use culturally validated versions when available

### Medical Comorbidity
- Physical illness can elevate somatic symptom scores
- Chronic pain, sleep disorders, and fatigue can inflate scores
- Interpret in context of medical conditions
