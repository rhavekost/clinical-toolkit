# PHQ-9 Item 9 Safety Protocol

Protocol for responding to positive responses on PHQ-9 Item 9 (suicidal ideation screening).

## Item 9 Question

"Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way"

**Response options:**
- 0 = Not at all
- 1 = Several days
- 2 = More than half the days
- 3 = Nearly every day

## Critical Rule

**ANY score > 0 on Item 9 requires immediate clinical follow-up.**

Do not proceed with the assessment without addressing suicidal ideation.

## Immediate Response Protocol

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Explore (Immediately)

**When patient endorses Item 9:**

1. **Stop** administration if not yet complete
2. **Acknowledge** the response directly and with concern
3. **Explore immediately** - do not wait until end of assessment

**What to say:**
- "I see you've indicated having thoughts about being better off dead or hurting yourself. I need to ask you more about this to make sure you're safe."
- "This is important. Can you tell me more about these thoughts?"

### Step 2: Conduct Full Safety Assessment

**Required assessment elements:**

Use comprehensive suicide risk assessment. See [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md) for complete protocol.

**Core questions:**

1. **Current ideation:**
   - "Are you currently thinking about hurting yourself or ending your life?"
   - "How often do you have these thoughts?"

2. **Plan:**
   - "Do you have a plan for how you would do it?"
   - If yes: "Can you tell me about your plan?"

3. **Intent:**
   - "Do you intend to carry out this plan?"
   - "How close have you come to acting on these thoughts?"

4. **Means:**
   - "Do you have access to [method mentioned]?"
   - Assess lethality and availability

5. **Timeframe:**
   - "When are you thinking about doing this?"
   - "Are you thinking about acting on these thoughts today?"

6. **Previous attempts:**
   - "Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or end your life before?"
   - If yes: "When was that? What happened?"

7. **Protective factors:**
   - "What has kept you from acting on these thoughts?"
   - "What reasons do you have for living?"
   - Family, religious beliefs, future plans, pets, etc.

8. **Recent changes:**
   - "Has anything changed recently that's made things worse?"
   - Losses, stressors, relationships, substance use

### Step 3: Assess Risk Level

**Risk Level Determination:**

**Low Risk:**
- Passive ideation only (thoughts of death without plan)
- No plan, no intent
- Strong protective factors
- No previous attempts
- Good support system
- Willing to engage in safety planning

**Moderate Risk:**
- Active ideation with vague plan
- Low intent ("I wouldn't actually do it")
- Mixed protective factors
- History of attempts (remote)
- Some impulsivity or substance use
- Ambivalent about safety

**High Risk:**
- Active ideation with specific plan
- Intent present
- Access to lethal means
- Weak protective factors
- Recent attempt or preparatory behaviors
- Impulsivity, agitation, or intoxication
- Limited support

**Imminent Risk:**
- Active plan with strong intent
- Immediate timeframe
- Access to means
- Recent attempt
- Psychotic symptoms
- No protective factors
- States cannot keep self safe

### Step 4: Intervene Based on Risk Level

**Low Risk Response:**

1. **Develop safety plan** (see template below)
2. **Remove means** if specific method considered
3. **Increase support** - contact support person
4. **Provide crisis resources:**
   - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
   - Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
   - Local crisis services
   - Emergency department if needed
5. **Schedule close follow-up** (within 24-48 hours)
6. **Consider referral** for mental health treatment if not engaged

**Moderate Risk Response:**

1. **All low-risk interventions, plus:**
2. **Same-day or next-day mental health evaluation**
3. **Increase monitoring** - daily check-ins
4. **Involve support system** (with patient consent)
5. **Remove means** (medications, weapons, etc.)
6. **Consider higher level of care** (IOP, PHP) if outpatient insufficient
7. **Consult with supervisor/psychiatry**

**High Risk Response:**

1. **Do not leave patient alone**
2. **Immediate mental health evaluation** - same day
3. **Consider emergency department referral**
4. **Call 988 or crisis team** for consultation
5. **Notify emergency contact** (as permitted)
6. **Remove all means**
7. **Consultation required** before releasing patient
8. **May require involuntary hospitalization**

**Imminent Risk Response:**

1. **Call 911 or take to emergency department immediately**
2. **Do not leave patient alone**
3. **Remove all means of self-harm**
4. **Notify emergency contact**
5. **May require police assistance** if patient uncooperative
6. **Document extensively**

### Step 5: Create Safety Plan

**Safety Plan Elements:**

### Step 6: Document Thoroughly

**Required documentation:**

See [../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md](../../docs/references/documentation-standards.md) for full documentation standards.

**Document:**

```

## Special Scenarios

### Item 9 Score of 1 ("Several Days")

**Still requires assessment**, but often represents:
- Passive ideation
- Fleeting thoughts
- "Life isn't worth living" type thoughts
- Usually lower risk

**Response:**
- Full safety assessment still required
- Often appropriate for low-risk protocol
- Safety plan and close follow-up
- Reassess at next contact

### Item 9 Score of 2-3 ("More Than Half the Days" or "Nearly Every Day")

**Higher concern:**
- Frequent ideation
- More persistent thoughts
- Higher risk for progression

**Response:**
- Very thorough safety assessment
- Often moderate to high risk
- May need urgent mental health evaluation
- Close monitoring essential

### Patient Minimizes After Endorsing Item 9

**Sometimes happens:**
- Patient endorses on paper
- Then says "I didn't really mean it" or "I would never do anything"

**Response:**
- Take paper response seriously
- Explore the discrepancy
- "I see you marked this on the form, but now you're saying something different. Can you help me understand?"
- Complete full safety assessment regardless
- Document both the endorsement and the minimization

### Patient Refuses to Answer Safety Questions

**If patient won't engage:**
- Document refusal
- Explain importance: "I need to know you're safe before you leave"
- Consult supervisor
- May need higher level of care if cannot assess safety
- Consider involuntary evaluation if high concern and won't cooperate

## Integration with Depression Treatment

### Item 9 Positive Does Not Mean "Do Not Treat Depression"

**Important:**
- Suicidal ideation is a symptom of depression
- Treating depression treats suicidal ideation
- Safety must be ensured, then depression treatment continues

**Treatment approach when Item 9 positive:**
1. Address safety first (immediate protocol above)
2. Ensure adequate safety monitoring
3. Initiate or continue depression treatment
4. Close follow-up
5. Consider medication evaluation if not already done
6. May need higher intensity treatment (more frequent therapy, IOP, etc.)

### Monitoring Item 9 During Treatment

**Track Item 9 specifically:**
- When readministering PHQ-9, note Item 9 score
- Improvement in Item 9 is critical outcome
- Worsening of Item 9 requires immediate reassessment
- Item 9 may improve before total PHQ-9 score improves significantly

## Consultation and Supervision

### ALWAYS Consult When:
- High or imminent risk
- Uncertain about risk level
- Patient refuses safety planning
- Complex presentation
- Your emotional response is strong
- First time managing suicidal patient
- Considering hospitalization

### Who to Consult:
- Clinical supervisor
- On-call psychiatrist
- Crisis team
- Emergency services (988, 911)

### Document Consultations:
- Who consulted
- When
- Clinical question
- Recommendations
- Decision made

## Training and Competence

**Before conducting suicide risk assessments:**
- Receive training in suicide risk assessment
- Practice with supervision
- Know your organization's protocols
- Know crisis resources in your area
- Understand involuntary commitment laws in your state

## Self-Care for Clinicians

**Managing suicidal patients is stressful:**
- Use supervision
- Debrief after high-risk cases
- Recognize your emotional reactions
- Don't carry the burden alone
- Know your limits

## Key Reminders

1. **ANY Item 9 > 0 requires full safety assessment**
2. **Do not assume low risk** - always assess
3. **Document thoroughly** - you will be glad you did
4. **When in doubt, consult**
5. **Safety first, then treatment**
6. **Follow your organization's protocols**
7. **Know your crisis resources**
