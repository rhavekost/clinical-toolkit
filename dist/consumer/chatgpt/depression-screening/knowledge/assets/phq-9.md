# Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)

## Overview
- **Items:** 9
- **Time:** 2-3 minutes
- **Purpose:** Assess depression severity aligned with DSM criteria
- **Population:** Adults (18+), validated in primary care and mental health settings

## Items

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?

**Response Scale:**
0 = Not at all
1 = Several days
2 = More than half the days
3 = Nearly every day

1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things
2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless
3. Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much
4. Feeling tired or having little energy
5. Poor appetite or overeating
6. Feeling bad about yourself — or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down
7. Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television
8. Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite — being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual
9. Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Item 9 screens for suicidal ideation. ANY score > 0 requires immediate clinical follow-up. See references/item-9-safety-protocol.md and docs/references/crisis-protocols.md**

## Scoring

**Algorithm:**
1. Sum responses to all 9 items
2. Total score range: 0-27
3. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity

**Interpretation:**
- 0-4: Minimal depression
- 5-9: Mild depression
- 10-14: Moderate depression
- 15-19: Moderately severe depression
- 20-27: Severe depression

For detailed clinical interpretation and treatment recommendations, see `references/severity-levels.md` and `references/clinical-decision-trees.md`

**Clinical Significance:**
- Cutoff ≥10: 88% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression
- 5-point change: Indicates treatment response
- 10-point change: Clinically significant improvement
