# Substance Use Severity Levels

This reference provides detailed interpretation of substance use severity across AUDIT-C and DAST-10 screening tools.

## AUDIT-C Severity Levels (Alcohol)

### Gender-Specific Cutoffs

**Why gender matters:**
- Women metabolize alcohol differently than men
- Women develop alcohol-related health problems at lower consumption levels
- Body composition differences affect blood alcohol concentration
- Higher health risks for women at equivalent consumption levels

### Men: Low Risk (0-3)

**Clinical Meaning:** Drinking within low-risk guidelines or abstinence

**Typical Pattern:**
- No alcohol use or occasional light drinking
- ≤14 drinks/week
- ≤4 drinks on any single day
- No negative consequences

**Recommended Actions:**
- Positive feedback on low-risk drinking
- Encourage continued pattern
- Brief education on standard drinks and limits
- Routine rescreening annually

### Women: Low Risk (0-2)

**Clinical Meaning:** Drinking within low-risk guidelines or abstinence

**Typical Pattern:**
- No alcohol use or occasional light drinking
- ≤7 drinks/week
- ≤3 drinks on any single day
- No negative consequences

**Recommended Actions:**
- Positive feedback on low-risk drinking
- Encourage continued pattern
- Brief education on standard drinks and limits
- Routine rescreening annually

### Men: Hazardous Drinking (4-5)

**Clinical Meaning:** Drinking above recommended limits with increased risk of harm

**Meets criteria for:** Severe substance use disorder

## Polysubstance Use Considerations

**DAST-10 Item 2 (polysubstance use):**
- Positive response indicates higher risk
- Complicates treatment
- Increases overdose risk
- May require treatment for multiple substances
- Assess all substances used

**Common combinations:**
- Alcohol + benzodiazepines (high overdose risk)
- Opioids + benzodiazepines (extreme overdose risk)
- Stimulants + opioids ("speedball" - high risk)
- Alcohol + cocaine (forms cocaethylene, cardiotoxic)

## Withdrawal Risk Assessment

**DAST-10 Item 9 (withdrawal symptoms) positive = physiological dependence**

### High Withdrawal Risk (Medical Supervision Required)
- Alcohol (seizures, delirium tremens)
- Benzodiazepines (seizures, death possible)
- High-dose opioids (severe discomfort, not typically life-threatening)

### Moderate Withdrawal Risk
- Moderate opioid use
- Stimulants (severe depression, suicidality)
- Cannabis (irritability, sleep disturbance)

**Never recommend abrupt cessation without medical evaluation if withdrawal endorsed**

## Co-Occurring Mental Health Disorders

**Very high comorbidity with substance use disorders:**
- Depression: 30-50%
- Anxiety disorders: 20-30%
- PTSD: 30-50% (especially in trauma-exposed populations)
- Bipolar disorder: 40-60%
- Psychotic disorders: 50%+

**Screening Required:**
- Depression: See ../../depression-screening/ (PHQ-9)
- Anxiety: See ../../anxiety-screening/ (GAD-7)
- PTSD: See ../../trauma-screening/ (PC-PTSD-5, PCL-5)
- Suicidal ideation: See ../../suicide-screening/ (ASQ, C-SSRS)

**Integrated treatment approach needed for co-occurring disorders**

## Treatment Response Monitoring

### Using AUDIT-C to Monitor Alcohol Treatment
- Readminister monthly during active treatment
- Goal often abstinence (score of 0)
- For moderation goals: reduction to low-risk range
- 2-point decrease = meaningful change

### Using DAST-10 to Monitor Drug Treatment
- Readminister monthly during active treatment
- Movement from higher to lower severity category = progress
- Goal typically score of 0 (abstinence)
- Watch for specific item changes (e.g., withdrawal, medical problems resolving)

## Special Population Considerations

### Pregnant Individuals
- **Any substance use during pregnancy = high risk**
- Immediate referral to prenatal care + addiction services
- Specialized perinatal substance use programs
- Do not abruptly stop opioids (fetal risk)
- MAT preferred over detoxification in pregnancy

### Adolescents/Young Adults
- Different screening tools may be more appropriate (CRAFFT)
- Brain development considerations
- Early intervention critical
- Family involvement important

### Older Adults
- May use lower cutoffs (physiological changes)
- Prescription drug misuse common
- Alcohol-medication interactions
- Cognitive screening if impairment noted

### Individuals with Chronic Pain
- Carefully assess prescription opioid use
- Distinguish dependence from addiction
- Multimodal pain management
- Taper planning if opioid use disorder present
