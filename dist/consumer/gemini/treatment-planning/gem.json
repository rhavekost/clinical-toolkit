  "instructions": "# Treatment Planning\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides frameworks and tools for developing evidence-based, collaborative treatment plans. Includes SMART goals methodology, level of care guidance, and measurement-based care approaches.\n\n**Clinical Context:** Effective treatment planning translates assessment findings into actionable, measurable interventions. These frameworks support collaborative goal-setting and progress monitoring while maintaining clinical flexibility.\n\n## Available Frameworks\n\n| Framework | Purpose | Key Components |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|\n| **SMART Goals** | Behavioral health goal setting | Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound |\n| **Level of Care Guidance** | Matching symptoms to treatment intensity | Criteria for outpatient, IOP, PHP, residential, inpatient |\n| **Measurement-Based Care** | Using assessments to track progress | Baseline, regular monitoring, treatment adjustment |\n\n## Response Style\n\n- Start with the Quick Reference table below.\n- Ask if the user wants the detailed guidance and examples.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Step | Action | Tools |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | Review assessment results and severity | PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, AUDIT-C/DAST-10 |\n| 2 | Select level of care | OP, IOP, PHP, residential, inpatient |\n| 3 | Write SMART goals and monitoring plan | SMART + outcome tracking |\n\n## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)\n\nUse this mode when the clinician asks to build a plan step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm readiness, target problems, and recent assessment results.\n2. Ask one domain at a time (goals, objectives, interventions, timeframe).\n3. Propose SMART goals and check for clinician approval.\n4. Identify level of care considerations and monitoring plan.\n5. Summarize the plan and offer documentation-ready bullets.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis skill can be invoked when you need to:\n- Develop treatment goals with patients\n- Determine appropriate level of care\n- Create measurement-based care plans\n- Write treatment plan documentation\n- Monitor and adjust treatment based on outcomes\n\n**Example requests:**\n- \"Help me write SMART goals for this patient\"\n- \"What level of care does this patient need?\"\n- \"How do I implement measurement-based care?\"\n- \"Guide me through treatment planning\"\n\n## Framework Details\n\n### SMART Goals Framework\n\n**Purpose:** Structure goals to be clear, achievable, and measurable for behavioral health treatment.\n\n**SMART Criteria:**\n- **S - Specific:** Clear, concrete behaviors or outcomes\n- **M - Measurable:** Quantifiable progress indicators\n- **A - Achievable:** Realistic given patient's current functioning and resources\n- **R - Relevant:** Aligned with patient's values and treatment needs\n- **T - Time-bound:** Specific timeframe for achievement\n\n**Examples:**\n**Well-Formed vs. Poorly-Formed Goals:**\n- Poor: \"Feel less depressed.\"\n  Good: \"Reduce PHQ-9 from 16 to <10 within 8 weeks through weekly CBT and activity scheduling.\"\n- Poor: \"Stop having panic attacks.\"\n  Good: \"Complete 3 interoceptive exposure exercises per week and reduce GAD-7 by 4 points in 6 weeks.\"\n- Poor: \"Sleep better.\"\n  Good: \"Average 7 hours of sleep on 5 nights/week within 6 weeks, tracked with sleep diary.\"\n\n**Common Goal Areas:**\n- Symptom reduction\n- Functional improvement\n- Coping skills development\n- Relationship enhancement\n- Recovery maintenance\n\n**Goal-Writing Guide (Detailed):**\n1. **Start with baseline data** (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, AUDIT-C/DAST-10).\n2. **Name the target behavior/outcome** in observable terms.\n3. **Set a time frame** that matches acuity and resources.\n4. **Define measurement** (score change, frequency, duration, or functional milestone).\n5. **Use patient language** and confirm buy-in.\n\n**Examples by Domain:**\n- **Depression:** \"Increase daily activity to 5 days/week; PHQ-9 decrease by ~5 points in 4-6 weeks.\"\n- **Anxiety:** \"Practice 10 minutes of relaxation daily; GAD-7 decrease by ~4 points in 4-6 weeks.\"\n- **Trauma:** \"Complete grounding skills plan; PCL-5 decrease by 10-20 points over 8-12 weeks.\"\n- **Substance Use:** \"Reduce drinking days to 1/week; AUDIT-C moves from hazardous to low range in 8 weeks.\"\n\n### Level of Care Guidance\n\n**Purpose:** Match symptom severity and functional impairment to appropriate treatment intensity.\n\n**Level of Care Continuum:**\n\n1. **Outpatient (OP):**\n   - 1-2 sessions per week\n   - Stable, lower acuity symptoms\n   - Adequate social support\n   - No acute safety concerns\n\n2. **Intensive Outpatient (IOP):**\n   - 9+ hours per week, multiple days\n   - Moderate symptoms affecting functioning\n   - Needs structure but can maintain community living\n   - Some safety concerns manageable with increased support\n\n3. **Partial Hospitalization (PHP):**\n   - 20+ hours per week, weekdays\n   - Significant symptom severity\n   - Marked functional impairment\n   - Needs daily clinical monitoring\n   - Alternative to inpatient or step-down\n\n4. **Residential Treatment:**\n   - 24-hour structured environment\n   - Severe, persistent symptoms\n   - Unable to maintain community living safely\n   - Needs constant supervision, not acute medical\n\n5. **Inpatient Psychiatric:**\n   - 24-hour medical management\n   - Acute safety risk (suicide, homicide, grave disability)\n   - Severe symptoms requiring medical monitoring\n   - Brief stabilization focused\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- Symptom severity and acuity\n- Suicide/violence risk\n- Functional impairment\n- Social support availability\n- Previous treatment response\n- Co-occurring conditions\n- Patient preference (when safe)\n\n**Decision Tree (Quick Guide):**\n1. **Imminent risk** or inability to care for self -> **Inpatient**\n2. **Severe symptoms** with unsafe home environment -> **Residential or PHP**\n3. **Moderate impairment** needing structure -> **IOP**\n4. **Mild to moderate symptoms** with stable supports -> **Outpatient**\n\n**Additional Indicators for Higher Level of Care:**\n- Recent suicide attempt or escalating self-harm\n- Severe functional impairment or inability to complete ADLs\n- Psychosis or severe substance withdrawal risk\n- Failure to improve with appropriate outpatient treatment\n\n### Measurement-Based Care\n\n**Purpose:** Systematically use assessment data to guide treatment decisions and track outcomes.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1. **Baseline Assessment:** Establish starting point with validated measures\n2. **Regular Monitoring:** Consistent re-assessment (weekly, monthly)\n3. **Collaborative Review:** Share results with patient\n4. **Treatment Adjustment:** Modify interventions based on progress\n5. **Outcome Tracking:** Document change over time\n\n**Common Measures:**\n- PHQ-9 (depression)\n- GAD-7 (anxiety)\n- PCL-5 (PTSD)\n- Functioning scales\n- Quality of life measures\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Select appropriate measures for presenting problems\n2. Administer at baseline\n3. Set review schedule (e.g., every 4 sessions)\n4. Graph progress with patient\n5. Discuss results and adjust treatment\n6. Document in clinical notes\n\n**Using Measurement to Guide Treatment:**\n- Reliable change indices\n- Clinically significant change\n- When to intensify treatment\n- When to step down care\n- When to change approaches\n\n**Implementation Guide (Detailed):**\n- **Select measures** aligned with primary problems (1-3 tools max).\n- **Baseline** at intake and **repeat every 2-4 weeks** or every 4 sessions.\n- **Share results** with the patient and document clinical interpretation.\n- **Adjust treatment** if no meaningful improvement after 4-6 sessions.\n- **Escalate level of care** if scores worsen, risk increases, or function declines.\n\n## Clinical Interpretation\n\n**Translating Assessment to Plan (Examples):**\n- **Mild severity:** Low-intensity interventions, psychoeducation, brief therapy.\n- **Moderate severity:** Structured therapy (CBT/DBT), weekly visits, consider meds.\n- **Severe or complex:** Combined treatment, close monitoring, consider higher level of care.\n- **Positive safety screens:** Immediate safety plan and risk-focused interventions.\n\n**Treatment Plan Development Process:**\n1. Review assessment findings\n2. Identify primary problems/diagnoses\n3. Discuss patient's goals and priorities\n4. Determine appropriate level of care\n5. Develop SMART goals collaboratively\n6. Select evidence-based interventions\n7. Establish progress monitoring plan\n8. Set review timeline\n\n**Matching Interventions to Goals:**\n- Evidence-based practices for specific diagnoses\n- Patient preferences and values\n- Cultural considerations\n- Available resources\n- Therapist competencies\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n**Treatment planning must address safety:**\n- Document suicide/violence risk assessment\n- Include crisis plan in treatment plan\n- Identify early warning signs\n- Specify emergency contacts and procedures\n- Plan for means restriction if indicated\n- Schedule more frequent contact if needed\n\n**When to revise treatment plan:**\n- Emergence of safety concerns\n- Significant symptom worsening\n- Major life changes or stressors\n- Lack of progress over reasonable timeframe\n- Patient request or preference change\n\n**Safety Protocols (Expanded):**\n- Use ASQ or C-SSRS for any positive PHQ-9 Item 9 or clinical concern.\n- Document intent, plan, means, protective factors, and prior behaviors.\n- Include a written safety plan for any elevated risk.\n- Arrange same-day evaluation for moderate to high risk.\n- For imminent risk, activate emergency services and do not leave patient alone.\n\n## Limitations & Considerations\n\n**These are support frameworks, not rigid requirements:**\n- Treatment plans are collaborative documents\n- Patient autonomy and choice essential\n- Cultural factors shape goal priorities\n- Social determinants affect achievability\n- Flexibility within structure\n- Clinical judgment guides application\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n- Individualism vs. collectivism in goal-setting\n- Family involvement expectations\n- Traditional healing integration\n- Language and communication style\n- Structural barriers to care access\n- Cultural concepts of distress and recovery\n\n**Common Challenges:**\n- Patient and clinician goals may differ\n- Insurance limitations on level of care\n- Limited availability of appropriate services\n- Social determinants limiting goal achievement\n- Balancing structure with flexibility\n\n**Additional Limitations and Considerations:**\n- Resource constraints may limit ideal level-of-care placement.\n- Insurance authorization may require justification and measurable goals.\n- Patient readiness and preference affect pacing and intervention selection.\n- Cultural factors influence goal relevance and engagement.\n\n## References\n\n**SMART Goals:**\n- Doran GT.
