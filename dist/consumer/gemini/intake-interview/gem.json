  "instructions": "# Intake Interview\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides structured interview guides and frameworks for comprehensive clinical intake assessment. These frameworks help ensure thorough evaluation while maintaining a conversational, patient-centered approach.\n\n**Clinical Context:** Structured interviews help clinicians gather essential information systematically while building therapeutic rapport. These are support frameworks that guide, not replace, clinical judgment and individualized assessment.\n\n## Available Frameworks\n\n| Framework | Focus | Population | Key Domains |\n|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|\n| **HEADSS Assessment** | Psychosocial screening | Adolescents | Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Safety |\n| **Biopsychosocial Template** | Comprehensive intake | All ages | Biological, psychological, social factors |\n| **Safety Assessment Protocol** | Risk evaluation | All ages | Suicide, homicide, violence, safety planning |\n\n## Response Style\n\n- Start with the Quick Reference table below.\n- Ask if the user wants the detailed prompt banks and decision pathways.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Step | Focus |\n|------|-------|\n| 1 | Explain confidentiality and limits (mandatory reporting) |\n| 2 | Screen safety early (SI/HI/abuse) |\n| 3 | Run HEADSS or Biopsychosocial |\n| 4 | Summarize 4Ps formulation and level of care |\n\n## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)\n\nUse this mode when the clinician asks to go step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm readiness and explain confidentiality/limits before starting.\n2. Screen safety early (SI/HI/abuse) and pause if urgent concerns arise.\n3. Ask one domain at a time from the selected framework and wait for responses.\n4. Summarize key findings and confirm accuracy before moving on.\n5. At the end, synthesize 4Ps and suggested next steps.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis skill can be invoked when you need to:\n- Conduct a comprehensive intake interview\n- Screen adolescents for psychosocial concerns\n- Structure a biopsychosocial assessment\n- Perform a systematic safety evaluation\n- Ensure thorough documentation of intake\n\n**Example requests:**\n- \"Help me conduct an intake interview\"\n- \"Guide me through a HEADSS assessment\"\n- \"I need a biopsychosocial interview template\"\n- \"How do I structure a safety assessment?\"\n\n## Framework Details\n\n### HEADSS Assessment (Adolescent Psychosocial Screening)\n\n**Purpose:** Structured framework for adolescent psychosocial screening covering key risk and protective factors.\n\n**Domains:**\n- **H - Home:** Living situation, family relationships, household stressors\n- **E - Education/Employment:** School performance, attendance, peer relationships\n- **A - Activities:** Hobbies, sports, peer groups, screen time\n- **D - Drugs:** Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, drugs), peer use\n- **S - Sexuality:** Sexual activity, orientation, safety, relationships\n- **S - Suicide/Safety:** Mental health, self-harm, violence exposure\n\n**Sample Questions by Domain:**\n\n**Home**\n- Who lives with you? How are things at home?\n- Any recent changes, conflict, or stressors?\n- Do you feel safe where you live?\n\n**Education/Employment**\n- How is school or work going? Attendance and performance?\n- Any bullying, learning challenges, or major stressors?\n- Goals or plans for the next year?\n\n**Activities**\n- What do you do for fun? Who do you spend time with?\n- Physical activity, hobbies, clubs, or faith community?\n- Screen time or social media use that feels problematic?\n\n**Drugs**\n- Any tobacco/vaping, alcohol, cannabis, or other substances?\n- How often? Any problems or consequences?\n- Do friends or family use?\n\n**Sexuality**\n- Are you dating or in a relationship? Any concerns?\n- Are you sexually active? Protection or contraception use?\n- Any questions about orientation, consent, or STI risk?\n\n**Suicide/Safety**\n- Any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?\n- Any self-harm, past attempts, plan, or intent?\n- Any exposure to violence, access to weapons, or feeling unsafe?\n\n### Biopsychosocial Template\n\n**Purpose:** Comprehensive intake structure addressing biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to current presentation.\n\n**Biological Factors:**\n- Medical history, current medications\n- Sleep, appetite, energy\n- Substance use\n- Family medical/psychiatric history\n\n**Psychological Factors:**\n- Mental status examination\n- Current symptoms and timeline\n- Previous mental health treatment\n- Trauma history\n- Coping strategies\n\n**Social Factors:**\n- Relationships and support system\n- Living situation and safety\n- Employment/education/finances\n- Cultural and spiritual factors\n- Legal involvement\n\n**Interview Guide (Prompt Bank):**\n\n**Presenting Problem**\n- Chief complaint in the patient's words\n- Onset, duration, triggers, and course\n- Current stressors and functional impact\n\n**Biological Factors**\n- Medical history, current medications, allergies\n- Sleep, appetite, energy, pain\n- Substance use and withdrawal symptoms\n- Family medical and psychiatric history\n\n**Psychological Factors**\n- Mood, anxiety, trauma exposure, psychosis symptoms\n- Prior mental health treatment and response\n- Coping strategies and strengths\n- Suicidality or self-harm history\n\n**Social Factors**\n- Housing stability and safety\n- Relationships and support system\n- Education/employment and finances\n- Cultural, spiritual, and identity factors\n- Legal issues or custody concerns\n\n**Strengths and Resources**\n- Protective factors, resiliency, motivation\n- Community supports and prior successes\n\n**Documentation Template (Biopsychosocial Intake Summary):**\n- Identifying info\n- Presenting problem and history of present illness\n- Biological factors\n- Psychological factors\n- Social factors\n- Risk assessment (suicide, violence, safety)\n- Strengths and protective factors\n- Diagnostic impression (provisional)\n- Level of care recommendation\n- Initial treatment plan and next steps\n\n### Safety Assessment Protocol\n\n**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of suicide, homicide, and safety risks with clear decision pathways.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Suicide Risk Assessment**\n   - Current ideation, intent, plan, means\n   - Prior attempts and self-harm\n   - Protective factors\n   - Risk stratification\n\n2. **Violence Risk Assessment**\n   - Homicidal ideation\n   - History of violence\n   - Access to weapons\n   - Target identification\n\n3. **Safety Planning**\n   - Warning signs\n   - Coping strategies\n   - Support contacts\n   - Means restriction\n   - Emergency resources\n\n4. **Disposition Decision**\n   - Level of care determination\n   - Follow-up planning\n   - Documentation requirements\n\n**Decision Pathway (Text-Based):**\n1. **Screen for safety early** (SI, HI, abuse, domestic violence, psychosis).\n2. **Imminent risk** (active intent, plan, means, or recent attempt):\n   - Emergency evaluation, do not leave patient alone, initiate emergency protocol.\n3. **Moderate risk** (active ideation without intent/plan, recent escalation):\n   - Full risk assessment, same-day clinical evaluation, increase contact frequency.\n4. **Low risk** (passive ideation only, no plan/intent):\n   - Safety plan, coping supports, outpatient follow-up.\n5. **No current risk**:\n   - Routine monitoring and preventive safety education.\n\n**Violence Risk Quick Check:**\n- Any thoughts of harming others?\n- Any specific target, plan, or access to weapons?\n- History of violence or recent escalation?\n\n## Clinical Interpretation\n\n**Clinical Formulation (4Ps Model):**\n- **Predisposing:** long-term vulnerabilities (trauma history, family history, temperament)\n- **Precipitating:** recent triggers (loss, conflict, medical illness)\n- **Perpetuating:** maintaining factors (avoidance, substance use, unstable housing)\n- **Protective:** strengths and supports (relationships, values, coping skills)\n\n**Synthesis Checklist:**\n- Working diagnosis and severity\n- Functional impairment and role impact\n- Risk level and safety needs\n- Level of care recommendation\n- Initial treatment focus and goals\n\n**Key Questions:**\n- What is the presenting problem and precipitants?\n- What biological, psychological, and social factors contribute?\n- What are the patient's strengths and resources?\n- What level of care is appropriate?\n- What are the treatment priorities?\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n**During intake assessment:**\n- Assess safety concerns early in interview\n- Be prepared to interrupt interview flow for safety issues\n- Have emergency protocols readily available\n- Know your crisis resources and referral pathways\n- Document all safety concerns and interventions\n\n**Mandatory Reporting:**\n- Be aware of mandatory reporting requirements (child abuse, elder abuse, danger to others)\n- Explain confidentiality limits at start of interview\n- Consult when uncertain about reporting obligations\n\n**Safety Protocols and Escalation:**\n- Assess safety before and after sensitive topics.\n- If imminent risk, follow emergency protocol and document all actions.\n- Use standardized tools (ASQ, C-SSRS) when indicated.\n- Develop a safety plan for any positive screen or elevated risk.\n- Discuss means safety (firearms, medications) and document counseling.\n- Coordinate with supervisors and collateral supports when appropriate.\n- Follow mandatory reporting laws (child/elder abuse, danger to others).\n\n## Limitations & Considerations\n\n**These are support frameworks, not rigid protocols:**\n- Adapt to patient's presentation and needs\n- Maintain conversational, empathic approach\n- Cultural humility in all assessments\n- Trauma-informed approach\n- Language and health literacy considerations\n- Allow patient to guide pacing and depth\n- Clinical judgment supersedes checklist completion\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n- Family structure and roles vary across cultures\n- Expression of distress differs\n- Help-seeking behaviors culturally influenced\n- Spirituality and traditional healing\n- Immigration and acculturation stress\n- Interpreter services when needed\n\n**Trauma-Informed Approach:**\n- Establish safety and choice\n- Transparency about process\n- Allow patient control over disclosure\n- Recognize potential for re-traumatization\n- Avoid forcing trauma narrative in initial intake\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Avoid checklist-only interviews; maintain therapeutic alliance.\n- Use trauma-informed, culturally responsive language.\n- Use interpreters when needed; document language access steps.\n- Be mindful of developmental stage and health literacy.\n- Reassess risk dynamically; it can change within the session.\n\n## References\n\n**HEADSS Assessment:**\n- Klein DA, Goldenring JM, Adelman WP.
