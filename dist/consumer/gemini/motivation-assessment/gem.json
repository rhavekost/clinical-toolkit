Use the brief readiness ruler for fast assessment and URICA access guidance for a more comprehensive profile.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Assessment | Items | Time | Purpose | Output | When to Use |\n|------------|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|\n| **Readiness Ruler** | 1-3 | <1 min | Rapid stage estimate | 0-10 rating | Quick triage, routine visits |\n| **URICA (access guidance)** | 32 | 5-10 min | Detailed readiness profile | Stage scores | Treatment planning, complex cases |\n\n## Assessment Tools\n\n### Brief Readiness Ruler\n\n**Full assessment and documentation:**\n→ [assets/readiness-ruler.md](assets/readiness-ruler.md)\n\n### URICA (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment) Access Guidance\n\n**Full assessment and documentation:**\n→ [assets/urica.md](assets/urica.md)\n\n## Interactive Administration (Optional)\n\nUse this mode when the clinician says \"start\" or \"administer\" readiness screening.\n\n1. **Readiness Ruler:** Ask the 0-10 rating(s) (importance, confidence, readiness) and record scores.\n2. **URICA:** Use the official form and scoring guidance; have the patient complete it, then record 1-5 responses and compute stage scores.\n3. Summarize the stage profile, identify the dominant stage, and offer stage-matched guidance.\n\n## Clinical Workflow\n\n1. **Select tool** (brief vs comprehensive)\n2. **Administer** readiness ruler or URICA\n3. **Score** and identify dominant stage\n4. **Match intervention** to readiness level\n\n## Documentation\n\nUse the templates in each asset file.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- Stage-based intervention guidance: [references/stage-matching.md](references/stage-matching.md)\n- TTM measures (public domain guidance): [references/ttm-measures.md](references/ttm-measures.md)\n\n## References\n\n- See references files in this skill and shared clinical references.\n",
