# Safety Planning

Comprehensive guide to creating and implementing safety plans for individuals at risk for suicide.

## Overview

A **safety plan** is a prioritized written list of coping strategies and sources of support that individuals can use before or during a suicidal crisis.

**Evidence-based approach developed by:** Stanley & Brown (2012)

**Use when:** Any level of suicide risk identified

**Complete crisis protocols:** [../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md](../../docs/references/crisis-protocols.md)

## Safety Plan Template

### Step 1: Warning Signs

**Identify personal warning signs that a crisis may be developing:**

"What thoughts, images, mood, situations, or behaviors indicate that a crisis may be starting?"

**Examples:**
- Thoughts: "I'm worthless," "Everyone would be better off without me"
- Images: Visualizing suicide methods
- Moods: Overwhelming hopelessness, rage, anxiety
- Situations: Being alone, arguments, anniversaries of losses
- Behaviors: Withdrawing from others, increased substance use, giving away possessions

**List patient's specific warning signs:**
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________

### Step 2: Internal Coping Strategies

**Things I can do to take my mind off my problems without contacting anyone:**

"What can you do on your own to help yourself get through this without acting on suicidal thoughts?"

**Examples:**
- Listen to music
- Exercise (walk, run, yoga)
- Take a shower or bath
- Play with pet
- Watch favorite movie/TV show
- Read
- Journal
- Pray or meditate
- Go to safe public place (coffee shop, library, park)

**List patient's specific strategies:**
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________

**Note:** If strategies don't work or crisis escalates, move to Step 3

### Step 3: People and Social Settings for Distraction

**People I can be around or social settings where I can distract myself:**

"Who can you be around, or what places can you go, even if you don't talk about the crisis?"

**Examples:**
- Visit a friend
- Go to family member's house
- Attend support group
- Go to church/temple/mosque
- Visit busy public place (mall, coffee shop)

**List patient's specific people/places:**
1. Name/Place: _____________ Contact: _____________
2. Name/Place: _____________ Contact: _____________
3. Name/Place: _____________ Contact: _____________

**Note:** If still in crisis, move to Step 4

### Step 4: People I Can Ask for Help

"Who can you talk to about what you're going through?"

**Friends/Family:**
1. Name: _____________ Phone: _____________ Available: _____________
2. Name: _____________ Phone: _____________ Available: _____________

### Step 7: Reasons for Living

"What are the things in your life worth living for?"

**Important to me:**
1. _____________ (children, family member, pet, friend)
2. _____________ (goal, value, belief, responsibility)
3. _____________ (activity, role, future plan)
4. _____________ (other)

**Note:** Refer to these during crisis - "Remember why you created this plan"

## Safety Plan Completion Process

### Creating the Plan

**Collaborative process:**
1. **Use patient's own words** - This is their plan, not yours
2. **Be specific** - "Call mom" better than "reach out to someone"
3. **Make it accessible** - Written copy, photo in phone, wallet card
4. **Prioritized** - Steps 1-6 in order
5. **Realistic** - Patient believes they can do these things

**During development:**
- Review each step thoroughly
- Practice using the plan
- Identify barriers ("What might stop you from using this?")
- Problem-solve barriers
- Get patient's agreement

### After Creating Plan

**Provide copies:**
- Give patient written copy
- Patient photos plan on phone (recommended)
- Consider wallet card version
- Keep copy in medical record
- Give copy to support person (with consent)

**Review and practice:**
- Walk through: "If you notice warning signs, what do you do first?"
- Role-play calling someone for help
- Identify specific phone numbers, addresses
- Ensure patient knows where plan is

**Follow-up:**
- Review plan at every visit
- Update as needed (new contacts, strategies, etc.)
- Ask: "Have you used your safety plan? What worked? What didn't?"

## Special Considerations

### Adolescents

**Adaptations:**
- Age-appropriate language and activities
- Include school counselor, trusted teacher
- Parent/guardian involvement in means restriction
- Texting may be preferred over calling
- Screen time limits - ensure crisis numbers accessible

### Substance Use

**Additional elements:**
- Avoid alcohol/drugs (increases impulsivity)
- Dispose of substances or give to support person
- Add sponsor or recovery support to contacts
- Include triggers related to use
- Sober activities in coping strategies

### Chronic Pain/Medical Illness

**Consider:**
- Pain management as part of coping
- Medical team in professional contacts
- Realistic activities given physical limitations
- Support groups for condition

### Cultural Considerations

**Adapt to:**
- Cultural values (family, community, spirituality)
- Language preference
- Cultural coping strategies (prayer, cultural practices)
- Family structure and support

## Common Challenges

### "I don't have anyone to call"

**Solutions:**
- Emphasize crisis lines (24/7, anonymous)
- Develop relationships (therapist, support group)
- Online support communities
- Peer specialists
- Text-based crisis support

### "Nothing will help"

**Approach:**
- Validate feelings while encouraging plan
- "It may feel that way now, but having a plan for the worst moments can help"
- Emphasize this is for worst crisis moments
- Even if patient skeptical, develop plan

### Patient refuses safety planning

**Consider:**
- Why refusing? (hopelessness, doesn't believe will help, wants to avoid talking about it)
- May indicate higher risk
- Engage around barriers
- Can be warning sign patient resolved to act

### "I'll just call 911"

**Response:**
- "That's great - 911 is on the plan (Step 5)"
- "But let's also think about earlier steps before crisis reaches that point"
- Emphasize prevention and early intervention

## Means Restriction Specifics

### Firearms (Most Lethal)

**Preferred: Complete removal from home**
- Store with family member, friend, gun shop
- Some police departments offer temporary storage
- Veteran service organizations may assist veterans

**If removal impossible:**
- Locked safe (someone else controls key/combo)
- Ammunition stored separately, also locked
- Someone else controls access
- Document plan and who controls access

**Never:**
- Leave firearm accessible "just locked"
- Trust patient to lock own firearm
- Leave ammunition accessible

### Medications

**Risk medications:**
- Opioids
- Benzodiazepines
- Tricyclic antidepressants
- Large quantities of any medication

**Strategies:**
- Remove excess (return to pharmacy)

### Other Means

**Based on patient's expressed methods:**
- Carbon monoxide: Remove car keys, secure garage
- Hanging: Remove ropes, cords, belts
- Jumping: Avoid high places, balconies

## Evidence Base

**Research shows safety planning:**
- Reduces suicide attempts
- Increases help-seeking
- Improves treatment engagement
- More effective than "no suicide contracts"

**Key elements for effectiveness:**
- Collaborative development
- Written and accessible
- Includes means restriction
- Regular review and update
- Actually used by patient

## Safety Plans vs. No-Suicide Contracts

### Safety Plans (Evidence-Based)

✓ Collaborative
✓ Focuses on coping
✓ Includes means restriction
✓ Provides specific resources
✓ Evidence supports effectiveness

### No-Suicide Contracts (NOT Recommended)

✗ Patient promises not to attempt
✗ No evidence of effectiveness
✗ False sense of clinician protection
✗ May damage therapeutic relationship
✗ Not a substitute for assessment

**Do NOT use "contracts for safety" - Use safety plans**
