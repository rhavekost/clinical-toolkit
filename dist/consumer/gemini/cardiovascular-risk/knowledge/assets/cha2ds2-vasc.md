# CHA2DS2-VASc Score

## Purpose
Estimate stroke risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

## Intended Population
Adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Not intended for valvular AF.

## Inputs
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Congestive heart failure or LV dysfunction | 1 | Clinical HF or reduced EF |
| Hypertension | 1 | Treated or untreated |
| Age >= 75 years | 2 | - |
| Diabetes mellitus | 1 | - |
| Stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism history | 2 | - |
| Vascular disease | 1 | Prior MI, PAD, or aortic plaque |
| Age 65 to 74 years | 1 | - |
| Sex category (female) | 1 | Biological sex |

## Algorithm
Sum points across all criteria. Score range: 0 to 9.

## Output
CHA2DS2-VASc total score.

## Interpretation
Higher scores indicate higher annual stroke risk. Use local AF guidelines to determine anticoagulation thresholds.

## Limitations
- Use clinical judgment and shared decision making.
- Not validated for rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves.

## Example Calculation
Female, age 70, hypertension, diabetes, no prior stroke, no vascular disease:
- Age 65 to 74 = 1
- Female sex = 1
- Hypertension = 1
- Diabetes = 1
- Total score = 4
