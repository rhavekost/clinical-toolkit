  "instructions": "# Pediatrics Calculators\n\n## Description\n\nThis skill provides structured guidance for pediatric clinical calculators and decision rules. It supports accurate input collection, calculation, interpretation, and safety caveats.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Tool | Use |\n|------|-----|\n| PECARN Head Injury Rule | Identify very low risk of clinically important TBI |\n| CDC Growth Charts | Growth percentiles for ages 2 to 20 years |\n| WHO Growth Standards | Growth percentiles for birth to 24 months |\n| Pediatric Weight-Based Dosing | Historical dosing rules (Clark, Young, Fried) |\n| Holliday-Segar | Maintenance fluid calculation (4-2-1 rule) |\n| Parkland Formula | Burn resuscitation volume calculation |\n\n## Interactive Mode (Lightweight)\n\n1. Confirm clinical context and intended tool.\n2. Collect required inputs with units and timing.\n3. Validate inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n4. Apply tool and present results with interpretation.\n5. Provide safety caveats and next-step guidance.\n\n## Tools\n\n- [PECARN Head Injury Rule](assets/pecarn-head-injury.md)\n- [CDC Growth Charts](assets/cdc-growth-charts.md)\n- [WHO Growth Standards](assets/who-growth-standards.md)\n- [Pediatric Weight-Based Dosing](assets/pediatric-weight-based-dosing.md)\n- [Holliday-Segar Maintenance Fluids](assets/holliday-segar.md)\n- [Parkland Formula](assets/parkland-formula.md)\n\n## Safety and Limitations\n\n- Support tool only; not diagnostic or prescriptive.\n- Use local policies and clinical judgment.\n- Pediatric calculations require age- and weight-appropriate validation.\n\n## References\n\nSee: [references/pediatrics-calculators-sources.md](references/pediatrics-calculators-sources.md)\n",
