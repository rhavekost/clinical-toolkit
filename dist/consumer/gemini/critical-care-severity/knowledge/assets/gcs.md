# Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

## Purpose
Standardized assessment of level of consciousness.

## Intended Population
Adults and children with altered mental status or trauma. Pediatric modifications exist for young children.

## Inputs
Three components scored separately:

### Eye Opening (E)
- 4: Spontaneous
- 3: To speech
- 2: To pain
- 1: None

### Verbal Response (V)
- 5: Oriented
- 4: Confused conversation
- 3: Inappropriate words
- 2: Incomprehensible sounds
- 1: None

### Motor Response (M)
- 6: Obeys commands
- 5: Localizes pain
- 4: Withdraws from pain
- 3: Abnormal flexion (decorticate)
- 2: Abnormal extension (decerebrate)
- 1: None

## Algorithm
`GCS Total = E + V + M`

## Output
Total score from 3 to 15.

## Interpretation
Common clinical categories:
- 13 to 15: mild impairment
- 9 to 12: moderate impairment
- 3 to 8: severe impairment (coma)

## Limitations
- Intubation or sedation can make verbal scoring untestable.
- Use the best response observed or recorded.

## Example
E3 + V4 + M6 = 13 (mild impairment)
