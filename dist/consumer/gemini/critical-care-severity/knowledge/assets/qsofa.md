# qSOFA

## Purpose
Rapid bedside screening to identify patients with suspected infection at higher risk of poor outcomes outside the ICU.

## Intended Population
Adults with suspected infection outside the ICU.

## Inputs
| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Respiratory rate >=22/min | 1 | - |
| Altered mentation (GCS <15) | 1 | - |
| Systolic BP <=100 mmHg | 1 | - |

## Algorithm
Sum points across the three criteria. Score range: 0 to 3.

## Output
qSOFA total score.

## Interpretation
A score >=2 suggests higher risk of poor outcomes and prompts further evaluation.

## Limitations
- Not a diagnostic test for sepsis.
- Use alongside clinical judgment and local sepsis protocols.

## Example
RR 26, SBP 98, GCS 15:
- Score = 2 (high risk)
