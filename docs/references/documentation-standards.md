# Documentation Standards

Clinical documentation standards for mental health assessments and treatment.

## Core Documentation Principles

### Legal and Ethical Requirements

**Documentation must be:**
1. **Accurate** - Reflect what actually occurred
2. **Timely** - Completed as close to service as possible
3. **Objective** - Based on observable data and validated tools
4. **Complete** - Include all required elements
5. **Professional** - Use appropriate clinical language
6. **Legible** - Readable by others (if handwritten)
7. **Secure** - HIPAA-compliant storage and transmission

### Documentation Standards

- Write as if the note will be read in court
- Use objective, descriptive language
- Quote patient verbatim for key statements
- Avoid judgmental or stigmatizing language
- Document clinical reasoning for decisions
- Note when standard procedures were followed or why they were modified

## SOAP Note Format

Standard format for clinical documentation.

### S - Subjective

**What the patient reports**

Include:
- Chief complaint (in patient's words, use quotes)
- History of present illness
- Patient's description of symptoms
- Changes since last contact
- Patient's perception of progress

**Example:**
```
S: Patient reports "I've been feeling really down for the past two weeks."
   Describes low mood, loss of interest in usual activities, difficulty
   sleeping, and feeling "worthless." States symptoms started after job
   loss. Reports thoughts of death but denies suicidal ideation, plan, or
   intent. "I would never do anything, I have kids."
```

### O - Objective

**What you observe and measure**

Include:
- Mental status examination
- Screening tool results
- Observed behaviors
- Physical presentation
- Test results or measurements

**Mental Status Exam Template:**
```
O: Mental Status Examination:
   - Appearance: [Grooming, hygiene, dress, eye contact]
   - Behavior: [Motor activity, cooperation, agitation]
   - Speech: [Rate, volume, tone, fluency]
   - Mood: [Patient's stated mood in quotes]
   - Affect: [Your observation - range, appropriateness, intensity]
   - Thought Process: [Linear, tangential, circumstantial, flight of ideas]
   - Thought Content: [Preoccupations, delusions, obsessions]
   - Perceptual Disturbances: [Hallucinations - type and content]
   - Suicidal Ideation: [Present/absent - detail if present]
   - Homicidal Ideation: [Present/absent - detail if present]
   - Cognition: [Orientation, attention, concentration, memory]
   - Insight: [Awareness of condition]
   - Judgment: [Decision-making capacity]

   Screening Results:
   - PHQ-9: [Score/27] - [Severity level]
   - GAD-7: [Score/21] - [Severity level]
   - [Other tools administered]
```

### A - Assessment

**Your clinical interpretation**

Include:
- Diagnostic impression (or rule-out diagnoses)
- Severity assessment
- Risk level (suicide, homicide, safety)
- Progress toward treatment goals
- Response to interventions
- Clinical reasoning for decisions

**Example:**
```
A: Moderate depressive episode with situational stressor (job loss).
   PHQ-9 score of 14 indicates moderate depression. Denies suicidal
   ideation with good protective factors (children, no plan/intent).
   Risk assessed as low. Symptoms appear reactive to identifiable
   stressor with some neurovegetative symptoms. Good insight and
   motivation for treatment.
```

### P - Plan

**What you will do**

Include:
- Immediate interventions
- Treatment plan or modifications
- Referrals
- Medications (if prescribing)
- Follow-up timing
- Safety planning
- Patient education provided
- Next steps and who is responsible

**Example:**
```
P:
1. Psychoeducation about depression and its connection to job loss
2. Initiated behavioral activation plan with activity scheduling
3. Discussed sleep hygiene for insomnia symptoms
4. Referred to psychiatry for medication evaluation (routine, within 2 weeks)
5. Provided crisis resources: 988, Crisis Text Line
6. Follow-up appointment scheduled in 1 week to monitor progress

## Documentation of Screening Tools

### Required Elements

When documenting screening tools:

1. **Tool name** (use full name and abbreviation)
2. **Date administered**
3. **Total score** and **score range**
4. **Severity interpretation**
5. **Specific items of concern** (especially safety items)
6. **Clinical interpretation**
7. **Action taken based on results**

### Example: PHQ-9 Documentation

```
PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) administered [date]:
Total Score: 14/27 (Moderate Depression)

Item-level concerns:
- Item 9 (Suicidal ideation): Score 0 - No thoughts of self-harm
- Items 3, 4 (Sleep, Energy): Both scored 3 (nearly every day)

Interpretation: Score indicates moderate depression with significant
neurovegetative symptoms (sleep, energy). Positive screen for major
depression (cutoff ≥10). No acute safety concerns.

Action: Initiated treatment plan for depression. Will reassess PHQ-9
in 2 weeks to monitor treatment response.
```

### Safety Item Documentation

**ANY positive response on safety screening items requires detailed documentation:**

```
PHQ-9 Item 9: Score 2 ("More than half the days")

DETAILED SAFETY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED:
- Ideation: Patient reports passive thoughts that "everyone would be
  better off without me" occurring most days
- Plan: Denies any plan for self-harm. "I wouldn't actually do anything"
- Intent: Denies intent to act. "I have kids who need me"
- Means: No access to firearms. No specific method considered.
- Previous attempts: None
- Protective factors: Responsibility to children (ages 8, 10),
  religious beliefs, no prior attempts

RISK LEVEL: Low (passive ideation without plan, intent, or means;
strong protective factors)

INTERVENTIONS:
- Safety plan developed and documented
- Crisis resources provided (988, Crisis Text Line)
- Follow-up scheduled in 3 days
- Patient agrees to contact crisis services or go to ED if thoughts
  escalate
- Patient instructed to remove alcohol from home (impulsivity risk)

See full safety plan in file. Patient verbalized understanding and
agreement with plan.
```

## Documentation Best Practices

### Language Guidelines

**Use objective, descriptive language:**
- ✓ "Patient appeared tearful and spoke in a quiet voice"
- ✗ "Patient was sad"

**Quote patient verbatim for key statements:**
- ✓ "Patient stated, 'I can't do this anymore, I just want to die'"
- ✗ "Patient expressed suicidal ideation"

**Avoid stigmatizing language:**
- ✓ "Patient with schizophrenia"
- ✗ "Schizophrenic patient"
- ✓ "Person who uses substances"
- ✗ "Substance abuser" or "addict"
- ✓ "Completed suicide"
- ✗ "Committed suicide"

**Be specific:**
- ✓ "Patient appeared disheveled with food stains on shirt,
     uncombed hair, and body odor"
- ✗ "Patient appeared unkempt"

### Common Documentation Errors to Avoid

1. **Vague language** - "Patient is doing better" (Better than what? By what measure?)
2. **Copy-paste errors** - Always review before signing
3. **Missing safety assessment** - Required when indicated
4. **No follow-up plan** - Always document next steps
5. **Illegible handwriting** - Type when possible
6. **Missing signature/credentials** - Legal requirement
7. **Delayed documentation** - Document contemporaneously
8. **Inadequate crisis documentation** - Must be detailed
9. **No diagnostic reasoning** - Explain your clinical thinking
10. **Missing patient involvement** - Document patient's input on plan

### Electronic Health Record Considerations

**When using templates:**
- Customize to patient's specific presentation
- Delete irrelevant sections
- Don't leave template language unchanged
- Review carefully before signing

**When using copy-forward:**
- Update all sections
- Remove outdated information
- Reflect current visit accurately
- Note what has changed since last visit

## Documentation Retention and Security

### Retention Requirements

- Federal: Minimum 6 years after last service (HIPAA)
- State laws vary: Check your state requirements
- Minors: Often until age of majority plus statute of limitations
- Check organizational policy
- When in doubt, retain longer

### Security Requirements

**Confidentiality:**
- HIPAA-compliant storage
- Encrypted electronic records
- Locked physical records
- Limited access (need-to-know basis)
- Secure transmission methods only

**Patient Access:**
- Patients have right to access records
- Process for requesting records
- Some restrictions for psychotherapy notes
- Timely response required (typically 30 days)

## Quality Documentation

**Good documentation:**
- Tells the story of the patient's care
- Supports clinical decision-making
- Demonstrates standard of care
- Protects both patient and provider
- Facilitates continuity of care
- Meets legal and regulatory requirements

**Remember:**
- If it wasn't documented, it didn't happen (legal perspective)
- Documentation should be thorough but concise
- Focus on clinically relevant information
- When uncertain, document more rather than less
- Seek supervision when unsure about documentation requirements
