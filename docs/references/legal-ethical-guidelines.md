# Legal and Ethical Guidelines

HIPAA compliance, informed consent, and professional standards for clinical practice.

## HIPAA Compliance Essentials

### What is HIPAA?

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects the privacy and security of patients' health information.

**Protected Health Information (PHI)** includes any information that can identify a patient and relates to:
- Past, present, or future physical or mental health
- Healthcare provided
- Payment for healthcare

### Common PHI Elements

**Identifiers that make information PHI:**
- Names
- Addresses (including email)
- Dates (birth, death, admission, discharge, etc.)
- Phone numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Medical record numbers
- Photos
- Any other unique identifying information

**De-identified information** (all 18 identifiers removed) is not PHI.

### HIPAA Privacy Rule

**Permitted uses of PHI without patient authorization:**

1. **Treatment** - Sharing PHI with other providers for patient care
2. **Payment** - Billing and receiving payment for services
3. **Operations** - Quality improvement, training, accreditation

**All other uses require patient authorization.**

### Patient Rights Under HIPAA

Patients have the right to:

1. **Access** their health records (with some exceptions)
2. **Request amendments** to their records
3. **Accounting of disclosures** - Who received their information
4. **Request restrictions** on uses/disclosures
5. **Confidential communications** - Choose how/where to be contacted
6. **Copy of Notice of Privacy Practices**
7. **File complaints** if they believe rights were violated

### Minimum Necessary Standard

**Only access/share the minimum PHI necessary** for the purpose.

**Examples:**
- ✓ Sharing diagnosis and current symptoms with consulting psychiatrist
- ✗ Sharing entire record with receptionist scheduling appointment
- ✓ Confirming appointment time with patient
- ✗ Discussing patient's diagnosis with scheduling staff

### Common HIPAA Violations to Avoid

1. **Leaving PHI visible** (papers on desk, computer screens visible to others)
2. **Discussing patients in public** (hallways, elevators, cafeteria)
3. **Unauthorized access** (looking at records of patients not in your care)
4. **Unsecured communication** (unencrypted email, text messages with PHI)
5. **Improper disposal** (PHI in regular trash instead of shredded)
6. **Sharing information without authorization** (even with family unless authorized)
7. **Social media** (never discuss patients on social media, even de-identified)

### HIPAA-Compliant Communication

**Email:**
- Use encrypted email for PHI
- Generic subject lines ("Appointment information" not patient name)
- Verify recipient before sending
- Consider patient consent for email communication

**Text Messages:**
- Avoid including PHI in texts when possible
- Use secure messaging platforms if available
- Generic messages okay ("Reminder: appointment tomorrow at 2pm")
- Never include clinical details via standard text

**Voicemail:**
- Minimal information ("This is [name] from [clinic], please call back")
- Don't leave test results, diagnoses, or detailed messages
- Confirm patient wants voicemails before leaving them

**Fax:**
- Use cover sheet
- Verify recipient fax number
- Confidentiality notice on cover sheet
- Verify receipt when possible

**Phone Calls:**
- Verify identity before discussing PHI
- Private location for calls
- Don't leave detailed messages
- Be careful in shared workspaces

### HIPAA Breach Response

**If breach occurs:**
1. Contain the breach immediately
2. Report to supervisor/privacy officer immediately
3. Document what happened
4. Cooperate with investigation
5. Patients may need to be notified (organization determines)
6. Learn from incident to prevent recurrence

**Breach examples:**
- Emailing PHI to wrong person
- Losing device with PHI
- Unauthorized person viewing records
- Leaving PHI in public location
- Discussing patient where overheard

## Informed Consent

### Elements of Informed Consent

Valid informed consent requires:

1. **Disclosure** - Providing relevant information
2. **Capacity** - Patient able to understand and decide
3. **Comprehension** - Patient actually understands
4. **Voluntariness** - Decision made freely, without coercion
5. **Consent** - Patient agrees to treatment

### Consent for Treatment

- Adolescents may have privacy rights for certain information
- Check state laws

**Involuntary commitment:**
- Different standards apply

**Incapacitated adults:**
- Guardian or healthcare proxy provides consent
- Advanced directives may guide care
- Emergency doctrine allows treatment without consent in emergencies

### Documenting Informed Consent

**Document in record:**
```
Informed consent for treatment obtained on [Date].

Discussed:
- Nature of treatment: [Therapy approach, assessments planned]
- Potential benefits: [Symptom reduction, skill development, etc.]
- Potential risks: [Temporary increase in distress, no guarantee of outcome]
- Alternatives: [Other treatment options, self-help, medication, etc.]
- Confidentiality and limits: [Privacy protections and mandatory reporting]
- Right to refuse or discontinue treatment
- Emergency procedures: [Crisis resources, after-hours contact]
- Fees and billing policies

Patient had opportunity to ask questions. Questions answered.
Patient verbalized understanding and provided consent for treatment.

[If written consent signed: Signed consent form in file]
```

## Mandatory Reporting Obligations

### Child Abuse and Neglect

**Who must report:**
- Mandated reporters (varies by state, typically includes mental health professionals)
- Standard: Reasonable suspicion, not proof

**What to report:**
- Physical abuse
- Sexual abuse
- Emotional abuse
- Neglect
- Exposure to domestic violence (in some states)

**How to report:**
- Call child protective services (CPS) immediately
- Follow up with written report (timeframe varies)
- Document report in patient record
- Do NOT investigate yourself

**After reporting:**
- May need to notify parent (unless parent is perpetrator)
- Continue treatment if appropriate
- Document ongoing safety monitoring

### Elder/Dependent Adult Abuse

**Similar to child abuse reporting:**
- Reasonable suspicion standard
- Physical, sexual, emotional abuse
- Neglect or financial exploitation
- Report to Adult Protective Services (APS)
- Document in record

### Tarasoff Duty to Warn/Protect

**When patient poses serious threat to identifiable victim:**

**Requirements (vary by state):**
1. **Warn** the potential victim
2. **Notify** law enforcement
3. **Take steps** to protect potential victim (may include hospitalization)

**Standard:**
- Serious threat of violence
- Identifiable victim
- Imminent risk

**Process:**
1. Assess threat seriously
2. Consult with supervisor/risk management
3. Document assessment thoroughly
4. Take appropriate protective actions
5. Document all steps taken

**Tarasoff does not apply to:**
- General threats without specific victim
- Property damage threats
- Non-imminent threats
- Threats patient clearly won't act on

### Documentation of Mandatory Reports

**Document thoroughly:**
- Facts leading to reasonable suspicion
- Date/time report made
- Agency reported to and name of recipient
- Report number if provided
- Information reported
- Patient/family notification (if applicable)
- Plan for follow-up

## Professional Boundaries

### Maintaining Appropriate Boundaries

**Professional boundaries protect patients and providers.**

**Multiple relationships to avoid:**
- Social relationships with current patients
- Business relationships with current patients
- Sexual/romantic relationships with current patients (NEVER)
- Treatment of family members or close friends
- Social media connections with patients

**Why boundaries matter:**
- Protect patient welfare
- Maintain objectivity
- Prevent exploitation
- Preserve therapeutic relationship

### Dual Relationships

**Unavoidable in some settings** (small communities, specialty populations):
- Acknowledge openly
- Consult with supervisor
- Document considerations
- Maintain primary therapeutic relationship
- Terminate if boundary becomes problematic

**Example:** In small town, may see patient at grocery store or community event. Professional, brief interaction appropriate; socializing would blur boundaries.

### Gifts and Self-Disclosure

**Gifts from patients:**
- Small, culturally appropriate gifts may be acceptable
- Expensive gifts should be declined
- Cash never acceptable
- Consider meaning and impact on therapeutic relationship
- Document and discuss in therapy

**Self-disclosure:**
- Use sparingly and purposefully
- Only if benefits patient
- Brief and relevant to patient's situation
- Doesn't shift focus from patient to therapist
- Consider cultural context

### Boundary Crossings vs. Violations

**Boundary crossing** - Minor deviation that doesn't harm (handshake, brief self-disclosure)

**Boundary violation** - Exploitation of patient, harmful (sexual contact, significant business dealings)

**If uncertain about boundary:** Consult supervisor before proceeding.

## Competence and Scope of Practice

### Practice Within Competence

**Only provide services within your:**
- Education and training
- Supervised experience
- Licensure scope of practice
- Ongoing competence through continuing education

**When to refer:**
- Patient needs exceed your competence
- Specialized treatment needed (eating disorders, specific trauma therapy)
- Different discipline needed (medication management)
- Complex diagnostic picture
- Your own limitations recognized

### Cultural Competence

**Obligation to:**
- Understand own cultural biases
- Learn about cultures of patients served
- Use culturally adapted interventions when appropriate
- Seek consultation for unfamiliar cultural contexts
- Respect cultural differences in help-seeking, symptoms, treatment

### Supervision and Consultation

**Use supervision/consultation when:**
- Uncertain about clinical decision
- High-risk situation (suicidality, abuse reporting)
- Ethical dilemma
- Practicing new skill
- Personal reaction interfering with objectivity

**Document consultations:**
- Who consulted
- Clinical question
- Recommendations
- Decision made

## Ethical Decision-Making

### When Facing Ethical Dilemma

1. **Identify the ethical issue** - What's the conflict?
2. **Consider stakeholders** - Who is affected?
3. **Review relevant guidelines** - Ethics code, laws, policies

5. **Consult** - Supervisor, ethics committee, legal counsel
6. **Make decision** - Choose course that best protects patient welfare
7. **Document** - Record reasoning and decision
8. **Review outcome** - Learn from the situation

### Common Ethical Dilemmas

**Patient wants records not sent to insurance:**
- Insurance may require records for payment
- Discuss options (private pay, what will be disclosed)
- Patient right to control information vs. insurance requirements

**Patient is danger to self but refuses higher level of care:**

- Patient autonomy vs. duty to protect
- May require involuntary hospitalization if danger is imminent

**Parent wants information about adolescent's therapy:**
- Adolescent privacy rights (vary by state)
- Parent's right to information about minor's care
- Balance therapeutic relationship with parental involvement
- Agree on boundaries at start of treatment

**Subpoena for records:**
