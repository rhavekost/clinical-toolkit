# Crisis Protocols

Universal crisis response procedures that apply across suicide-screening, depression-screening (Item 9), and trauma-screening.

## Immediate Response Protocols

### When Crisis is Identified

1. **Stay with the person** - Do not leave them alone
2. **Ensure immediate safety** - Remove access to means of self-harm if possible
3. **Activate emergency response if needed** - Call 988, 911, or emergency services
4. **Document thoroughly** - Record all assessments, interventions, and decisions

### Crisis Severity Levels

**Level 1: Low Imminent Risk**
- Passive ideation without plan or intent
- Good protective factors present
- Willing to engage in safety planning
- **Response:** Safety plan, close follow-up, refer for treatment

**Level 2: Moderate Risk**
- Active ideation with some plan but low intent
- Mixed protective factors
- Ambivalent about safety
- **Response:** Consider higher level of care, same-day mental health evaluation, safety plan, remove means

**Level 3: High Imminent Risk**
- Active ideation with plan and intent
- Access to means
- Poor protective factors
- Recent attempt or aborted attempt
- **Response:** Immediate emergency evaluation, do not leave alone, call 988/911, likely hospitalization

**Level 4: Acute Emergency**
- Attempt in progress or just occurred
- Severe self-harm
- Psychotic features with command hallucinations
- **Response:** Call 911 immediately, provide first aid, do not leave alone

## Escalation Pathways

### Decision Tree for Crisis Response

```
Crisis Identified
    ↓
Is person in immediate danger?
    ↓ YES → Call 911, stay with person, ensure safety
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Can safety be ensured in current setting?
    ↓ YES → Develop safety plan, arrange close follow-up
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Is person willing to go to emergency evaluation?
    ↓ YES → Arrange transport, contact emergency dept
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Does situation meet criteria for involuntary evaluation?
    ↓ YES → Contact crisis team/police for evaluation
    ↓ NO → Continue safety planning, increase monitoring
```

### Consultation Requirements

**ALWAYS consult with supervisor/senior clinician when:**
- High or acute risk level identified
- Considering emergency department referral
- Involuntary commitment being considered
- Unsure about risk level
- Complex case with multiple risk factors
- Your own emotional response interferes with judgment

**Document all consultations** including:
- Who was consulted
- When consultation occurred
- Recommendations received
- Decisions made

## Safety Planning

### Elements of a Safety Plan

A safety plan should include:

1. **Warning signs** - Personal signs that crisis may be developing
2. **Internal coping strategies** - Things person can do without contacting others
3. **Social contacts and settings** - People and places that provide distraction
4. **People who can help** - Family, friends who can be contacted for support
5. **Professionals to contact** - Therapist, crisis line, emergency services with specific numbers
6. **Means restriction** - Specific steps to limit access to lethal means

- Store at gun range, with family member, or law enforcement

- Age-appropriate language for safety planning
- Increased supervision requirements

### Older Adults

- Assess medical comorbidity
- Evaluate capacity for safety planning
- Consider caregiver involvement
- Higher lethality of attempts

### Individuals with Psychosis

- Assess for command hallucinations
- May require immediate hospitalization
- Antipsychotic medication may be urgent
- Reality testing may be impaired

### Substance Use

- Assess current intoxication level
- Increased impulsivity when intoxicated
- May need detox before full assessment possible
- Substance removal is means restriction

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Duty to Protect

Clinicians have a duty to protect individuals from self-harm, which may include:
- Warning family members (with or without consent in emergency)
- Involuntary emergency evaluation
- Hospitalization
- Breaking confidentiality when necessary to protect life

### Documentation and Liability

- Document thoroughly and contemporaneously
- Record clinical reasoning for all decisions
- Consult when uncertain
- Follow organizational policies
- Know your state's involuntary commitment laws

### Confidentiality Limits

Crisis situations may require breaking confidentiality:
- Inform person of confidentiality limits at outset
- Break confidentiality only to extent necessary
- Document reason for disclosure
- Inform person of disclosure when safe to do so

## Self-Care for Clinicians

### After Crisis Response

- Debrief with supervisor or peer
- Process your own emotional reactions
- Recognize secondary trauma
- Take breaks when possible
- Use consultation and support

### Recognize Your Limits

- Not all crises can be prevented
- You cannot control another person's choices
- Seek supervision when feeling overwhelmed
- Professional support is essential for this work
