    ↓
Severe symptoms requiring daily monitoring?
    ↓ YES → PHP (can maintain safety overnight)
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Moderate-severe needing intensive structure?
    ↓ YES → IOP (3+ hours per day, multiple days/week)
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Mild-moderate symptoms, stable?

## Managing the Referral Process

### Before Making Referral

4. **Get consent** - For release of information
5. **Set expectations** - Timeline, what patient should do

### Making the Referral

1. **Choose appropriate level** - Match to clinical need
2. **Provide complete information** - Use documentation template
3. **Indicate urgency** - Be clear about timeframe needed
4. **Follow up** - Confirm receipt, appointment scheduled

### After Referral

1. **Bridge care** - Continue seeing patient until specialty care begins
2. **Confirm appointment** - Check that patient attended
3. **Maintain communication** - Request updates from specialist
4. **Coordinate care** - Continue collaboration if providing ongoing care

### If Referral Declined or Delayed

**If patient declines referral:**
- Explore barriers and concerns

**If appointment delayed:**

## Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation

**Do not wait for routine referral if:**
- Suicidal ideation with plan/intent develops
- Patient decompensates while waiting
- New dangerous symptoms emerge
- Functioning deteriorates significantly
- Patient expresses they cannot wait safely

**Action:** Convert to emergency/urgent referral or emergency services

## Documentation of Referral

6. **If declined** - Document patient choice and your recommendations

### Track Referrals
