## Depression Screening

### PHQ-9 Scoring

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-4 | Minimal depression | *[To be added]* |
| 5-9 | Mild depression | *[To be added]* |
| 10-14 | Moderate depression | *[To be added]* |
| 15-19 | Moderately severe depression | *[To be added]* |
| 20-27 | Severe depression | *[To be added]* |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥10: Cutoff for major depression (88% sensitivity, 88% specificity)
- 5-point change: Indicates treatment response
- 10-point change: Clinically significant improvement

**Item 9 (Suicidal Ideation):** ANY score >0 requires immediate follow-up

### PHQ-2 Scoring

| 5-9 | Mild anxiety | *[To be added]* |
| 10-14 | Moderate anxiety | *[To be added]* |
| 15-21 | Severe anxiety | *[To be added]* |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥8: High sensitivity (92%) and specificity (76%)

## Trauma Screening

### PC-PTSD-5 Scoring

*[Scoring table and interpretation to be added]*

**Key Facts:**
- Yes/No format

**Key Thresholds:**
- 10-12 point change: Clinically significant improvement
- Score <28: May indicate return to healthy population range

**Subscale Structure:**
- Cluster B (Items 1-5): Re-experiencing
- Cluster C (Items 6-7): Avoidance
- Cluster D (Items 8-14): Negative cognitions/mood

## Suicide Risk Screening

### ASQ Interpretation

*[Scoring guide and response protocols to be added]*

- Moderate: Active ideation without specific plan
- High: Active ideation with plan and/or intent
- Imminent: Plan + intent + means, or recent attempt
