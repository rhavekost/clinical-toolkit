## Depression Screening

### PHQ-9 Scoring

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-4 | Minimal depression | Monitor, provide psychoeducation, rescreen if symptoms change |
| 5-9 | Mild depression | Watchful waiting, brief intervention, reassess in 2-4 weeks |
| 10-14 | Moderate depression | Active treatment (psychotherapy and/or medication), monitor 2-4 weeks |
| 15-19 | Moderately severe depression | Combined treatment often indicated, closer follow-up, assess safety |
| 20-27 | Severe depression | Immediate treatment, specialty referral, consider higher level of care, safety assessment |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥10: Cutoff for major depression (88% sensitivity, 88% specificity)
- 5-point change: Approximate minimal clinically important difference (MCID); larger changes indicate greater improvement

**Item 9 (Suicidal Ideation):** ANY score >0 requires immediate follow-up

### PHQ-2 Scoring

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 0-2 | Negative screen | Routine monitoring; administer PHQ-9 only if clinical concern |
| 3-6 | Positive screen | Administer full PHQ-9 and assess functional impact |

---

## Anxiety Screening

### GAD-7 Scoring

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-4 | Minimal anxiety | Monitor, provide psychoeducation, rescreen if symptoms change |
| 5-9 | Mild anxiety | Watchful waiting, skills-based support, reassess in 2-4 weeks |
| 10-14 | Moderate anxiety | Active treatment (CBT and/or medication), monitor 2-4 weeks |
| 15-21 | Severe anxiety | Active treatment, consider specialty referral, assess safety and impairment |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥10: Commonly used cutoff for GAD
- 4-point change: Estimated minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in some settings; confirm locally

### GAD-2 Scoring

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 0-2 | Negative screen | Routine monitoring; administer GAD-7 only if clinical concern |
| 3-6 | Positive screen | Administer full GAD-7 and assess functional impact |

---

## Ultra-Brief Screening

### PHQ-4 Scoring

**Total score (0-12):**
- 0-2: None
- 3-5: Mild
- 6-8: Moderate
- 9-12: Severe

**Subscales:**
- Anxiety (items 1-2): 0-6
- Depression (items 3-4): 0-6

**Triage guidance:** Total ≥6 or subscale ≥3 → administer PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7.

---

## Distress Screening

### K6 / K10 Scoring (0-4 coding)

- K6 total range: 0-24
- K10 total range: 0-40
- Higher scores indicate greater distress.
- Use setting-specific cutoffs where available.

### Common Cutoffs (Verify Locally)

- **K6:** ≥13 is commonly used to indicate high likelihood of serious mental illness.
- **K10:** 10-19 likely well, 20-24 mild, 25-29 moderate, 30-50 severe.

## Trauma Screening

### PC-PTSD-5 Scoring

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 0-2 | Negative screen | No further PTSD assessment unless clinical concern |
| 3 | Possible PTSD | Consider PCL-5 if symptoms or risk factors present |
| 4-5 | Positive screen | Administer full PCL-5 and conduct clinical interview |

**Key Facts:**
- Yes/No format
- Cutoff of 4 is commonly used; some settings use 3 for higher sensitivity

### PCL-5 Scoring

| Score Range | Interpretation | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0-30 | Below PTSD threshold | Monitor; reassess if symptoms persist or clinical concern remains |
| 31-33 | Probable PTSD (provisional cutoff) | Clinical interview to confirm DSM-5 criteria; consider treatment planning |
| 34+ | Probable PTSD (higher confidence) | Full assessment and treatment planning; assess safety and comorbidity |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Cutoff 31-33 indicates probable PTSD (provisional)
- 5-10 point change suggests reliable change; 10-20 point change suggests clinically meaningful improvement

**Subscale Structure:**
- Cluster B (Items 1-5): Re-experiencing
- Cluster C (Items 6-7): Avoidance
- Cluster D (Items 8-14): Negative cognitions/mood
- Cluster E (Items 15-20): Arousal/reactivity

## Substance Use Screening

### AUDIT-C Scoring

| Score Range (Men) | Score Range (Women) | Risk Level | Clinical Actions |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|
| 0-3 | 0-2 | Low | Positive feedback, rescreen annually |
| 4-5 | 3-4 | Hazardous | Brief intervention, reassess in 1-3 months |
| 6-7 | 5-7 | Harmful | Brief intervention + assessment, consider referral |
| 8-12 | 8-12 | Severe | Specialty referral, consider higher level of care |

**Key Cutoffs:**
- Men: ≥4 indicates hazardous drinking
- Women: ≥3 indicates hazardous drinking

### DAST-10 Scoring

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0 | No problems | Positive feedback, routine monitoring |
| 1-2 | Low level | Brief counseling, monitor at follow-up |
| 3-5 | Moderate level | Full assessment, consider treatment referral |
| 6-8 | Substantial level | Specialty referral recommended |
| 9-10 | Severe level | Immediate specialty referral, consider higher level of care |

## Suicide Risk Screening

### ASQ Interpretation

**Negative screen:** "No" to all questions 1-4

**Positive screen:** "Yes" to any of questions 1-4
- Perform brief suicide safety assessment or full C-SSRS
- Determine acuity, protective factors, and level of care

**Acute positive screen:** "Yes" to question 5 (past week)
- Immediate safety evaluation and escalation per crisis protocol

**Key Principle:** ANY "yes" answer to questions 1-4 is a POSITIVE SCREEN requiring immediate evaluation

### C-SSRS Interpretation

**Important:** C-SSRS does not produce a numeric risk score. Risk level is based on the most severe ideation endorsed and any suicidal behavior.

**Risk stratification (quick guide):**
- **High risk:** Yes to ideation with intent/plan (Q4/Q5) OR suicidal behavior in past 3 months
- **Moderate risk:** Active ideation without intent/plan (Q3) and no recent behavior
- **Low risk:** Passive ideation only (Q1/Q2) and no behavior

**Actions:**
- **Low:** Safety plan, outpatient follow-up, means safety counseling
- **Moderate:** Same-day evaluation, increase support, consider higher level of care
- **High/Imminent:** Emergency evaluation, continuous safety measures

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: Passive ideation, no intent, no plan, no behavior
- Moderate: Active ideation without specific plan
- High: Active ideation with plan and/or intent
- Imminent: Plan + intent + means, or recent attempt

## Measurement-Based Care

### Reliable Change Index (RCI)

RCI helps determine whether symptom change exceeds measurement error.

**Steps:**
1. Obtain test-retest reliability (r) and baseline SD from the instrument manual or validation study.
2. Compute `SEdiff = SD * sqrt(2 * (1 - r))`.
3. Compute `RCI = (post - pre) / SEdiff`.
4. `|RCI| >= 1.96` indicates reliable change (p < .05).

### Clinically Significant Change

Clinically significant change usually requires:
- Reliable change (RCI threshold met), AND
- Movement from the clinical range into a non-clinical range (or meeting an established cutoff)

**Common change guidance (when RCI inputs are unavailable):**
| Instrument | Change Guidance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| PHQ-9 | ~5-point change | Estimated MCID for monitoring |
| GAD-7 | ~4-point change | Estimated MCID in some settings |
| PCL-5 | 5-10 points reliable; 10-20 points meaningful | VA guidance |
