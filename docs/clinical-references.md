## Depression Screening

### PHQ-9 Scoring

|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-4 | Minimal depression | *[To be added]* |
| 5-9 | Mild depression | *[To be added]* |
| 10-14 | Moderate depression | *[To be added]* |
| 15-19 | Moderately severe depression | *[To be added]* |
| 20-27 | Severe depression | *[To be added]* |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥10: Cutoff for major depression (88% sensitivity, 88% specificity)
- 5-point change: Indicates treatment response
- 10-point change: Clinically significant improvement

**Item 9 (Suicidal Ideation):** ANY score >0 requires immediate follow-up

### PHQ-2 Scoring

*[Scoring table and interpretation to be added]*

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-4 | Minimal anxiety | *[To be added]* |
| 5-9 | Mild anxiety | *[To be added]* |
| 10-14 | Moderate anxiety | *[To be added]* |
| 15-21 | Severe anxiety | *[To be added]* |

**Key Thresholds:**
- Score ≥8: High sensitivity (92%) and specificity (76%)
- Score ≥10: Commonly used cutoff for GAD
- 5-point change: Clinically significant improvement

### GAD-2 Scoring

*[Scoring table and interpretation to be added]*

---

## Ultra-Brief Screening

### PHQ-4 Scoring

**Total score (0-12):**
- 0-2: None
- 3-5: Mild
- 6-8: Moderate
- 9-12: Severe

**Subscales:**
- Anxiety (items 1-2): 0-6
- Depression (items 3-4): 0-6

**Triage guidance:** Total ≥6 or subscale ≥3 → administer PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7.

---

## Distress Screening

### K6 / K10 Scoring (0-4 coding)

- K6 total range: 0-24
- K10 total range: 0-40
- Higher scores indicate greater distress.
- Use setting-specific cutoffs where available.

### Common Cutoffs (Verify Locally)

- **K6:** ≥13 is commonly used to indicate high likelihood of serious mental illness.
- **K10:** 10-19 likely well, 20-24 mild, 25-29 moderate, 30-50 severe.

## Trauma Screening

### PC-PTSD-5 Scoring

*[Scoring table and interpretation to be added]*

**Key Facts:**
- Yes/No format
- Score of 3-4 indicates positive screen
- Gender considerations: 4 for males, 3 for females may be optimal

### PCL-5 Scoring

| Score Range | Interpretation | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0-30 | Below PTSD threshold | *[To be added]* |
| 31-33 | Probable PTSD (provisional cutoff) | *[To be added]* |
| 34+ | Probable PTSD (higher confidence) | *[To be added]* |

**Key Thresholds:**
- 10-12 point change: Clinically significant improvement
- Score <28: May indicate return to healthy population range

**Subscale Structure:**
- Cluster B (Items 1-5): Re-experiencing
- Cluster C (Items 6-7): Avoidance
- Cluster D (Items 8-14): Negative cognitions/mood
- Cluster E (Items 15-20): Arousal/reactivity

## Substance Use Screening

### AUDIT-C Scoring

*[Scoring table and interpretation to be added]*

**Key Cutoffs:**
- Men: ≥4 indicates hazardous drinking
- Women: ≥3 indicates hazardous drinking

### DAST-10 Scoring

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Actions |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| 0 | No problems | *[To be added]* |
| 1-2 | Low level | *[To be added]* |
| 3-5 | Moderate level | *[To be added]* |
| 6-8 | Substantial level | *[To be added]* |
| 9-10 | Severe level | *[To be added]* |

## Suicide Risk Screening

### ASQ Interpretation

*[Scoring guide and response protocols to be added]*

**Key Principle:** ANY "yes" answer to questions 1-4 is a POSITIVE SCREEN requiring immediate evaluation

### C-SSRS Interpretation

*[Detailed scoring and risk stratification to be added]*

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: Passive ideation, no intent, no plan, no behavior
- Moderate: Active ideation without specific plan
- High: Active ideation with plan and/or intent
- Imminent: Plan + intent + means, or recent attempt

## Measurement-Based Care

### Reliable Change Index (RCI)

*[Tables for calculating reliable change for each instrument to be added]*

### Clinically Significant Change

*[Guidelines for determining clinically meaningful improvement to be added]*

### Outcome Tracking Template

Template: [docs/templates/outcome-tracking.md](templates/outcome-tracking.md)

---

## Sleep Tracking

### Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)

- Use the official unaltered diary form for 1-2 weeks.
- Summarize trends in sleep onset latency, awakenings, and total sleep time.
- See the CSD project site for the official form and citation requirements.

---

## Motivation Assessment

### Readiness Ruler (Brief)

- 0-3: Precontemplation
- 4-6: Contemplation
- 7-8: Preparation
- 9-10: Action/Maintenance

### URICA (Stage Profile)

- Calculate stage subscales and identify dominant stage.
- Use stage-matched interventions to guide approach.
- UMBC HABITS Lab lists TTM measures (including URICA) as public domain.

## Original Non‑Validated Tools

These tools are original checklists and interview guides. They are **not validated instruments** and are **not diagnostic**.

- Bipolar Risk Interview Guide
- Functional Impairment Interview
- Eating Risk Checklist
- Cognitive Concerns Intake

## Medication Safety

### Opioid MME

- Use CDC conversion factors for MME calculations.
- Do not use MME for equianalgesic conversion when switching opioids.
- Use extra caution with methadone and fentanyl.

## Cross-Tool Workflow Chaining

### Depression Pathway

**Use when:** universal screening, depression complaints, or positive PHQ-2.

1. PHQ-4 (if available) for ultra-brief screen
2. PHQ-9 for severity and treatment monitoring

### Distress Pathway

**Use when:** nonspecific distress or high K6/K10 scores.

1. K6 or K10 for distress screening
2. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 for symptom specificity
3. Suicide risk assessment if distress is severe or safety concerns emerge

### Sleep Pathway

**Use when:** sleep complaints or early treatment response tracking.

1. Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) for 1-2 weeks
2. PHQ-9 to evaluate depressive symptoms
3. GAD-7 to evaluate anxiety symptoms
4. Substance use screen if indicated (AUDIT-C/DAST-10)

### Adolescent Pathway

**Use when:** adolescent intakes or general mental health screening.

1. PHQ-4 (or PHQ-2/GAD-2 if PHQ-4 not available)
2. HEADSS for structured adolescent intake
