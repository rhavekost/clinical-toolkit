# Tool Expansion Plan (Licensing‑Safe)

**Objective:** Expand the toolkit with legally permitted instruments and original tools. All additions must have explicit permission for open‑source reproduction or be original, non‑validated tools.

---

## A. Open‑Licensed Additions (Green‑Light)

### A1. PHQ‑4 Ultra‑Brief Screening
- **Status:** Allowed for reproduction and distribution.
- **Plan:** Keep current PHQ‑4 skill; add workflow chaining and citations.

### A2. TTM / URICA Measures
- **Status:** Public domain per UMBC HABITS Lab.
- **Plan:** Keep URICA access guidance; add optional TTM measures list.

### A3. Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD)
- **Status:** Free for not‑for‑profit use, unaltered with citation.
- **Plan:** Use official form via link; include summary workflow.

---

## B. Restricted or Unclear Tools (Excluded)

These require permission, are restricted, or lack explicit open reproduction rights and must **not** be included:

- **MDQ** (bipolar)
- **SDS / WHODAS** (functioning)
- **ISI** (insomnia severity)
- **SCOFF** (eating disorders)
- **Mini‑Cog / MoCA** (cognitive screening)
- **Beers Criteria** (geriatric meds)

---

## C. Open, Original (Non‑Validated) Tools

These are original tools and **not validated**; they must be labeled accordingly.

- Bipolar Risk Interview Guide
- Functional Impairment Interview
- Eating Risk Checklist
- Cognitive Concerns Intake

---

## D. Additional Areas We Can Add Legally

### D1. Opioid MME Calculator
- **Status:** CDC conversion factors are permissible for use with attribution.
- **Plan:** Provide calculation steps + cautions (no equianalgesic conversion).

### D2. Workflow & Documentation Tools
- Prior‑auth letter templates
- Referral letters
- Return‑to‑work notes
- Safety plans

### D3. Calculator Frameworks (If Formulas Are Public)
- ASCVD risk: **possible** if equations are public domain; requires verification.
- Pediatric dosing: **likely restricted** without public‑domain dosing tables.

## E. Execution Steps

1. Add/open‑licensed skills (PHQ‑4, URICA access, CSD).
2. Add original non‑validated tools.
3. Add opioid MME calculator.
4. Update manifests, README, clinical references, and templates.
5. QA pass for compliance and clarity.
