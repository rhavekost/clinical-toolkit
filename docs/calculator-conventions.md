# Calculator Conventions

These conventions apply to all clinical calculator skills added to the toolkit.

## Units and Inputs

- Always state units for every input.
- Accept common unit variants when feasible and provide conversions.
- Explicitly list valid ranges and reject values that are physiologically impossible.

## Rounding Rules

- Keep full precision for intermediate steps unless the source specifies otherwise.
- Round final outputs to clinically standard precision.
- If rounding impacts thresholds, show both raw and rounded values.

## Output Format

- Present the numeric result first.
- Provide an interpretation category if defined by the source.
- Include any risk estimate ranges or confidence bands when available.

## Validation and Safety

- Require all mandatory inputs before calculation.
- Flag inputs that make the formula invalid.
- Include population limits and exclusions.
- Include a concise disclaimer for clinical judgment.

## Disclaimers

- These tools support clinical decision making but do not replace clinical judgment.
- Use local policies and professional scope of practice.
- Do not use in populations outside the validated scope.
